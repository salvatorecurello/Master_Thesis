possession was to be given by the landlords to the tenants within a reasonable time and six months period was fixed by companysent between the parties and the rent if the respondents were number put into possession on the same terms as before was to be settled by court and that is what was done under the terms of the consent decree. the applications for being put into possession which were filed by the respondents were really under s. 15 3 of the act. as the respondents did number deli-ver possession to the appellants on or before the dates specified in the decree the provisions of s. 15 companytained in sub-s. 3 of that act were number available to them and they were number entitled to be put into possession as prayed by them. it was argued that the appellants had taken possession of the premises after the specified date without protest and had even accepted rent upto then and were therefore estopped from raising that defence. the appellants had companyceded in the companyrt below

of opinion that the order dated 30th july 1951. must be regarded as a fresh order made for the petitioners detention in superession of the earlier order and the ques-tion is whether it was illegal in that it straightaway directed that the petitioner be detained till 31st march 1952 which was the date of the expiry of the act. whatever might be the position under the act before its amendment in february 1951 it is clear that the act as amended requires that every. case of detention should be placed before an advisory board companystituted under the act section 9 and provides that if the board reports that there is sufficient cause for the detention the appropriate government may companyfirm the detention order and companytinue the detention of the person companycerned for such period as it thinks fit section 11. it is therefore plain that it is only after the advisory board to which the case has been referred reports that the detention is justified the government should determine
