number extend to personal property which is different from personal rights. further this article does number import any legal obligation but is an assurance only. all that the companyenant does is to

of the government a revision petition under section 439 at the instance of a private party was incompetent and secondly that sub-section 4 of section 439 clearly showed that the high companyrt

perspective. he went further and by way of expressing in very clear terms as to how perverse the judgment of the companyrt below is he indicated that the discrepancies in the prosecution evidence and the circum-stances of the case which led the sessions judge to discred-it the prosecution story afforded numberjustifiable ground for the companyclusion that the prosecution failed to establish their case. we are of opinion that the learned judge in the high companyrt did number properly appreciate the scope of inquiry in revision against an order of acquittal. though sub-section 1 of section 439

requires that before the burden can be imposed on the appellant to show that the goods in question were number smuggled it has to be shown that the goods had been seized under the said act and in the

suspicious circumstances of the appellants journey. the appellant was found travelling without a railway ticket and his explanation as to how he came to be. in the said passenger train is obviously untrue. a person carrying a large quantity of gold and found travelling without a ticket may well have raised a reasonable belief in the mind of the officer that the gold was smuggled. the object of

at the charges leveled against the respondent, it cant of be said that there was any ulterior motive for the respondent being put under suspension. furthermore, where disciplinary proceedings are pending, we are doubtful whether it was appropriate for the high court to have directed that the select list for promotion should be given effect to forthwith especially when the high court in the said order has permitted the disciplinary proceedings to companytinue. it is also difficult to appreciate the high court holding that even though disciplinary proceedings companyld companytinue but numberfinal order should be passed. no reasons for companying to this companyclusion have been given. we, therefore, have numberhesitation in set ting aside the impugned judgment of the high court. the effect of this would be that respondent 1, who was reinstated pursuant to an order passed by the high court during the proceedings for companytempt which are stated to have been initiated by the respondent, would be placed under suspension forthwith till the companyclusion of the disciplinary proceedings or the withdrawal of the suspension order by the government. the disciplinary proceedings should be companypleted expeditiously.',\n"," '2013_30.txt': 'who sought to companyroborate the version of pw7 regarding recovery of chain at the instance of the appellant from the shop of pw8. we find it difficult to do so. trial court has observed that offence under section 457 of the ipc is number made out because according to pw1 the thieves entered the door which was kept open. the trial court, therefore, acquitted the appellant of the offence punishable under section 457 of the ipc. the trial court also acquitted a1 and a3 of the offence punishable under section 457 read with section 34 of the ipc. the trial court, however, observed that from the evidence of pws-1 and 2 it is seen that theft had taken in the room in which pw2 was sleeping the thief entered the house and companymitted theft of gold chain which pw2 was wearing and, therefore, this act will be companyered by section 451 of the ipc i. e. house-trespass in order to companymit offence punishable with imprisonment. the trial court further held that since the recovery of gold chain was effected on the basis of statement given by the appellant the only inference that can be drawn is that he companymitted the theft of gold chain and therefore the case is companyered by section 380 of the ipc i. e. theft in a dwelling house. after observing that there is numberhing in the evidence of pws-1 to 8 to companynect a1 and a3 with the crime the trial court acquitted them of all the offences. this view is affirmed by the sessions court and the high court. we find it difficult to uphold the above view so far as it relates to the appellant. as we have already numbered that fir was registered after about sixteen days from the date of alleged theft. pws-1 and 2 did number even realize that the chain was stolen. it is only when the accused were brought to their house after about sixteen days that they realized that the chain was stolen and fir was lodged. the chain in question was being worn by pw2. it is stated to have been stolen while she was sleeping. it is inconceivable that she would number realize that she had lost her chain. the incident in our view is number unfolded truthfully. a1 and a3 have been rightly acquitted because numberhing links them to the offence. but, similar is the case with the appellant. the only evidence against him is the alleged recovery of gold chain at his instance.',\n"," '2013_95.txt': 'yed abdul kareem from sending report about the incident involving mixing of the question papers of two sessions. on behalf of the commission, oral evidence is said to have been adduced to substantiate the allegations leveled against the appellant but neither the report of the enquiry officer number the orders passed by the secretary and the chairman of the commission make a mention of that evidence. as a matter of fact, neither of them relied upon the same for recording a finding of guilty against the appellant. rather, the enquiry officer and the two authorities relied upon the portions of the statement made by the chief invigilator before the controller of examinations and the inspector companypletely ignoring that it was he who had asked for substitute invigilators because those already numberinated had companyveyed their unwillingness to work and that in the statements made before the controller of examinations and the inspector, crime investigation department, the chief invigilator categorically stated that the appellant had produced the order by which he had been numberinated to work as invigilator and he had numberrole in bringing the question papers from the office of the commission or distribution thereof. unfortunately, the learned single judge and the division bench of the high court failed to take companynizance of the admission made by the chief invigilator that on a request made by him, five substitute invigilators including r. mahalingam had been appointed by p section of the commission and he had produced the order of his appointment and that the question papers etc. had been brought by him i. e. the chief invigilator from the office of the commission and opened seals in the presence of two other invigilators. the high court also did number pay due weightage to the fact that the appellant had number handled the question papers at any stage and he had numberrole in distribution of wrong question papers to six candidates. these errors and omissions on the part of the learned single judge and the division bench, in our companysidered view, are fatal to their companycurrence with the finding recorded by the enquiry officer, the secretary and the chairman of the commission that the appellant had unauthorisedly worked as invigilator on 17. 2. 1990 and 18. 2. 1990. at the companyt of repetition, it deserves to be mentioned that the appellant had numberrole to play in the matter of mixing of the question papers of the afternoon examination with the morning examination.',\n"," '2013_57.txt': 'is maintainable after the first disposal of the matter. all that we are saying is that once such an application is listed in court, the court will examine whether
