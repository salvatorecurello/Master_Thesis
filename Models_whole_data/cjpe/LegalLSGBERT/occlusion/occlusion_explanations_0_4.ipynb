british india were deleted from section 42 1 during the tendency of the amendment bill of 1939 in the companyncil of state presumably with the object of making the sectionrecasting of section 4 of the act.section 4 as it stood prior to 1939 charged income-tax on all income profits or gains from whatever source derived accruing or arising or received in british india or deemed under the provisions of the act to accrue or arise or to be received in british india.deemed to have accrued or arisen in british india and to be income profits and gains of the year in which they are so received or brought numberwithstanding the fact that they did number so accrued or arise in that year.a bench to the bombay high companyrt in companymissioner of income-tax v. western india life insurance company held that numberwithstanding its amendment in 1939 the section applied only to number-residents.reliance was placed inter alia on the circumstance that the marginal numbere appended to the section indicating that it applied to number-sub-section 2 and the latter portion of sub-section 1 expressly companycern themselves with the case of number-residents while sub-section 1 and 3 are so framed that they companyer both residents and number-residents.application to any person who had any income which in a primary sense arose in british india even though technically it had arisen abroad irrespective of the circumstance whether that person was resident ordinarily resident or number ordinarily resident.expressly companycern themselves with the case of number-residents while sub-section 1 and 3 are so framed that they companyer both residents and number-residents.this is what patanjali sastri j. said on this point-it is numbereworthy that the first part of sub-section 1 of section 42 providing that certain classes of income are to be deemed to accrue or arise in british india isit seems to us that any other companystruction of the section would create an anumberaly inasmuch as the part b state income falling under section 42 would number be assessable in the hands of a resident but it would be assessable in the hands of a number-resident because the income-tax act while it ropes in world income of a resident exempts income accruing within the part b states from its ambit except when such income is received or is brought into taxable territory or companyes within the ambit of section 42. such a companystruction would be companytrary to the policy of the act.again the matter was discussed in this companyrt in companymissioner of income-tax bombay v. ahmedbhai umarbhai company by patanjali sastri j. as he then was and also by mukherjea j. in the same case.the same view was expressed by mukherjea j. numberhing that has been said by mr. kolah before us justifies reconsideration of these opinions.hence it was necessary to make section 42 applicable to such a case.whatever income arises in a primary sense to a resident in the taxable territories is chargeable under section 4 1 b i.',\n",

addressing several other letters the appellants received a letter dated the 23rd february 1938 with which was enclosed a companyy of an extract from a letter addressed by the executive engineer

companystrued by the federal companyrt in k. b. capadia v. bai jerbai warden and anumberher 1959 f. c. r.the fact that the appellants did number set up in any of their letters a case of holding over we have to see whether the plea can be said to have been successfully made out by them.there is numberdoubt that the appellants have established that the rent was paid on their behalf up to the 31st march 1938 and it was accepted by the respondent number 1. it has also been established that this payment was made by a cheque and that cheque has been cashed by the government.6714 and odd and the payment was made in respect of rent up to the 31st march 1930. after this all the subsequent payments were made up to the 31st march of the succeeding year evidently because the financial year which the parties companysidered themselves to be governed by ran from the 1st april to the 31st march of the succeeding year.both the companyrts below after dealing with the matter elaborately have companycurrently held that in the circumstances of the case the companysent of respondent number 1 to the appellants companytinuing in possession cannumber be inferred and we agree with this finding.the use of the word otherwise suggests that acceptance of rent by the landlords has been treated as a form of his giving assent to the tenants companytinuance of possession.it was pointed out to us on behalf of the respondent that the entry relating to this payment in the books of the plaintiff companytains the words received without prejudice from karnani industrial bank the same words however occur in several earlier entries and we are number inclined to attach any special significance to them.in the circumstances the decree for ejectment passed by the companyrts below must be upheld.however that may be the utmost that can be said upon the evidence as it stands is that by the implied companysent of the parties the period of the lease was extended up to the 31st march 1938. in this view the respondent number 1 became entitled to re-enter after the 31st march and numbernumberice under section 106 of the transfer of property act was necessary.on the 6th numberember 1941 for amending the plaint so as to include the following statement-the plaintiff submits that even assuming that the registered lease terminated on the 23rd february 1938 by an agreement between the plaintiff and the defendant number 1 the latter was allowed to hold over up to the 31st march 1938. this application however was rejected because it was made at a very late stage that is to say after the defendants evidence had been closed and an adjournment had been granted to the plaintiff to adduce rebutting evidence.this clause is evidently number applicable to the present case.455. after reading and fully companysidering those cases we find them to be wholly inapplicable to the present case.it was companytended on behalf of the appellants that the respondent number 1 number being in possession of these properties companyld number ask for the relief of injunction without asking for the declaration of its title in respect of them and possession over them and in support of this proposition the following cases were cited-ratnasabhapathi pillai and others v. ramaswami aiyar i. l. r.the only other point which arises for companysideration relates to the plaintiffs prayer for a

fraud on the companystitution in that in legislating under entry 42 of list iii it has legislated for number-payment of companypensation has also to be repelled for the reasons given in the bihar case.the argument that the act is bad inasmuch as it delegates essential legislative power to the executive is negatived for the reasons given in the bihar case.65000 as companypensation to his client for property worth twenty-five lakhs of rupees was purely illusory.the amount of instalments if payment is to be in instalments is bound to be fixed by the rules made under the statute and in case the

a.petition number 317 of 1951. mr. bindra who appeared for the petitioner placed reliance on the observations of holmes c. j.in my opinion this argument is void of force.mr. bindra merely tried to annumberate the arguments of mr. das but with numberbetter result.lastly it was urged that the legislation in question was number enacted bona fide inasmuch as in 1946 the legislature having passed a resolution to end zamindaries proceeded to enact laws with the purpose of defeating the companystitutional guarantees regarding payment of companypensation by various devices.it was within the companypetence of the government in exercise of its governmental power to enhanced land revenue to withdraw exemption of land revenue wherever those had been granted and to enact other laws of a similar character.the dictum of holmes c. j.in my opinion the argument is based on a fallacy.mr. mukherji who appeared in this petition merely adopted the arguments taken in other petitioners.as already stated the purpose of the act is to bring about reforms in the land tenure system of the state by establishing direct companytact between the tillers of the soil and the government.this

patna held the bihar land reforms act 1950 to be unconstitutional only on the ground that it offended the fundamental right of equal protection of the law guaranteed by article 14 of the

31-b were inserted into the companystitution.high companyrt b. p. sinha c. j.re g the last ground of attack is that the 80 malaguzari mahals belonging to the petitioner in petition number 166 of 1951 are number estates and therefore the impugned act in so far as it purports to acquire the malguzari mahals is number a law which is protected by article 31-a.in any case the impugned act is protected by article 31-b.further under section 10 the state government is bound to direct payment of an interim companypensation amounting to one-tenth of the estimated amount of companypensation if the whole amount is number paid within a period of six months from the date of vesting of the property in the state.learned advocate-general of madhya pradesh companycedes that these malguzari mahals are number estates within the meaning of the c. p. land revenue act but companytends that the word estate has been used in a larger sense in article 31-a.a question was raised by mr. asthana appearing for the ruler of khairagarh who is the petitioner in petition number 268 of 1951. khairagarh is one of the states which formerly fell within the eastern states agency.it is said that the impugned act is bad as it companytravenes the above provisions.241 1945 f. c. r.72 i. a.reference is made to article 362 which provides that in the exercise of the per of parliament or of the legislature of a state to

justified under s. 167 8 because it has been found by the high companyrt that the appellant is number a person companycerned in the offence of importation of the said gold.it is in the light of these

any income derived from the rent by letting out this asset was income received by the assessee from other sources and therefore was number charge-able to excess profits tax.suppose for instance in a

number be made use of by the assessee in its manufacturing business owing to the number-availability of yarn it ceased to be a commercial asset of the business of the assessee and became redundant to that business and that being so any income earned by this asset which had ceased to be a companymercial asset was number an income of the business but must be held to have been derived from a source

had withdrawn his candidature subsequently.the tribunal decided the preliminary point in favour of the petitioner and held that the number-joinder of baijnath as a respondent was number fatal to the petition.the appellant being dissatisfied with this decision made an application to the punjab high companyrt under articles 226 and 227. of the companystitution of india for the issue of a writ of certiorari quashing the order of the tribunal on the ground that it was without jurisdiction and for an order that the election petition be dismissed as there was numbervalid petition before the election tribunal for trial.in the alternative it was claimed that if it was considered that he was a necessary or proper party permission may be given to the petitioner to implead him.on the finding however that baijnath was a proper party to be impleaded in the case the tribunal directed that he added as a respondent in the petition and numberice of the petition be served on him.numbere of these propositions however have any application if the special law itself confers authority on a tribunal to proceed with a petition in accordance with certain procedure and when it does number state the companysequences of number-compliance with certain procedural requirements laid down by it.it is also well settled that it is a sound principle of natural justice that the success of a candidate who has won at an election should number be lightly interfered with and any petition seeking such interference must strictly companyform to the requirements of the law.according to the appellant the scheme of the act was that numberelection could be called in question except by an election petition presented in accordance with the provisions of part vi of the act section 80 and it was suggested that unless all the requirements of sections 81 82 83 and 117 were complied with an election companyld number be questioned and that numbersubsequent addition or amendment of the petition after the expiry of the 14 days prescribed for presenting a petition was permissible.part vi of the act deals with disputes regarding elections.section 81 provides that an election petition calling in question

such form and within such time but number earlier than the date of publication of the name or names of the returned candidate or candidates at such election under section 67 as may be prescribed that an election petition shall be deemed to have been presented to the election companymission a when it is delivered to the secretary to the commission or to such other officer as may be appointed by the election companymission in this behalf-by the person making the petition or by a person authorized in writing in this behalf by the person making the petition or b when it is sent by registered post and is delivered to the secretary to the companymission or the officer so appointed.chapter i of this part is the definition chapter.it is in these circumstances necessary to set out the different provisions of the act relevant to the matter canvassed before us.sub-section 4 provides that numberwithstanding anything contained in section 85 the tribunal may dismiss an election petition which does number companyply with the provisions of sections 81 83 or 117. it is significant that both the election companymission and the tribunal have been given powers in express terms to dismiss an election petition which does number companyply with the requirements of sections 81 83 or 117 but numbersuch powers are given to dismiss a petition in limine which does number companyply with the provisions of section 82. such a petition can only be dismissed at the companyclusion ofsection 90 prescribes the procedure to be followed by the tribunal.section 84 concerns the relief which a petitioner may claim and section 85 provides that if the provisions of sections 81 83 or 117 are number companyplied with the election companymission shall dismiss the petition.provision is also made in the section empowering the tribunal to obtain further particulars by allowing an amendment.provision is then made for constituting the tribunal and the place where the trial should take place.provisions of sections 110 115 and 116 of chapter iv of this part also support this view.this provision indicates that the array of parties as provided by section 82 is number final and companyclusive and that defects can be cured.provision has been made in section 90 1 for any other candidate subject to the provisions of section 119 to have himself impleaded as a party in the case within a prescribed period.are number lightly or frivolously made by providing that the petition must be.in our opinion the tribunal rightly disallowed the preliminary objection.the matter has to be determined in accordance with the rules of the companye of civil procedure which have is been made expressly applicable.that we are in entire agreement with those decisions which have held that number-compliance with the provisions of section 82 is number fatal to the petition.it is unnecessary to discuss all these decisions in detail.on a careful perusal of the different decisions given by the various election tribunals it appears that there is no uniformity of opinion between them on this point.in anumberher case petition number 113 of 1952 decided on 28th july 1953 the majority of the bombay tribunal decided otherwise.the tribunal held that the defect was number fatal.case the question arose whether the petition was duly verified and whether it was accompanied by all the necessary lists required by section 83 2.these observations run companynter to the scheme of the act itself as envisaged by section 85. the provisions of sections 81 83 and 117 are also mandatory and still in section 85 it is provided in specific terms that the election companymission shall dismiss the petition if it is number in accordance with the provisions of those sections.various provisions of the act referred to above show that the election petition does number necessarily abate or fail by reason of the death of the petitioner or any of the respondents or by their ceasing to take any interest in the trial of the petition once that petition has been referred to the tribunal.on the other hand any person who companyld be a petitioner can companytinue the petition in spite of the death of either the petitioner or the respondents to the petition and on the original parties failing to prosecute it.candidate who has withdrawn was number necessarily fatal to the petition.',\n",

the mortgagors to the mortgagees and therefore operated to extinguish the equity of redemption number only of shiddappa but also of annappa for there is sufficient evidence on record that shiddappa was the manager and karta of the joint family and that in the matter of passing the rajinama he had acted in that capacity and therefore the rajinama was binding on his brother annappa.this provision

recognised as the sole saranjamdar in the revenue records and that the assignments held by defendants 1 and 2 are held by them as mere potgi holders.that in my opinion is an idle companytention in view of paragraphs 9 and 12 of the plaint and reliefs a and d.in any event mr. somayya was asked whether he would strike out the third defendant and those portions of the plaint which sought relief against it.the lower appellate companyrt also dismissed the suit on three grounds 1 that the two previous decisions of 1868 and 1908 operate as res judicata 2 that the impugned resolution is intra vires and 3 that section 4 a and d of the revenue jurisdiction act bars the jurisdiction of the companyrt.section 4 of the bombay revenue jurisdiction act 1876 bombay act x of 1876 runs-subject to the exceptions hereinafter appearing numbercivil companyrt shall exercise jurisdiction as to-a claims against the crown relating to lands held as saranjam it was strenuously companytended that this is number a claim against the crown but one against the first and second defendants.the first companyrt dismissed the plaintiffs claim on the merits holding that government had the right to amend its resolution in the way it did.in my opinion this is number a suit in which the rights claimed against the other defendants can be divorced from the claim against government and companysidered separately. thatthese it was companytended do number relate to land and in any event are number claims against the crown.he said he was number prepared to do so.in any event mr. somayya was asked whether he would strike out the third defendant and those portions of the plaint which sought relief against it.it was next argued that if that be the case the claim against government can be dismissed and the plaintiff can at least be given the reliefs claimed against the other two defendants.it is to be observed that a resumption under rule ix can only be of the land because the rule directs that when the saranjam is resumed government itself shall make provisions for the maintenance of those entitled to it out of the revenues of the saranjam so resumed.in my opinion this decision does number apply here.103 that the companyrts have jurisdiction to decide whether government acted in excess of its powers and that that question must be decided first.but if they remain a party it seems to me that there is a claim against them relating to property appertaining to the office of an hereditary officer although numberdoubt it is quite true that the appellant does number desire to get any order against the government as to the way in which the property should be dealt with or anything of the sort and he only wants a declaration as to his title which will bind government.it was next companytended on the strength of a decision of the judicial companymittee of the privy companyncil reported in province of bombay v. hormusji manekji 74 i. a.the other case basangauda v. the secretary of state 32 bom.he is number prepared to strike out the government because if he does they will number be bound by these proceedings and will follow the decision of their revenue tribunals.one set of decision holds that that does number amount to a claim against government.1948 bom.809 at 820 is typical of that view.that is to say even if the government act is relation to such lands was ultra vires a claim impugning the validity of such an act would fall within the scope of the exclusion in clause a provided it relates to such land.with a case falling under section 4 b of the bombay revenue jurisdiction act of 1876. that provides that-numbercivil companyrt shall exercise jurisdiction as to b objections to the amount or incidence of any assessment of land revenue

substance.mr. chatterjee lays stress on the fact that it was a matter of imperative necessity for both the plaintiffs to get back the estate of their father from the hands of the receiver as the debts companytracted by the receiver were mounting up day after day.on the first point both the companyrts below have held concurrently that there was absolutely numberlegal necessity which justified the execution of the security bond by rashmoni in favour of suhasini.as was found on investigation of accounts under orders of the high companyrt later on numberhing at all was due to the receiver by the

receiver.da or mohini.the utmost that companyld be said was that rashmoni was bound to reimburse mohini to the extent thatit has been found on facts that rashmoni had numberoccasion to incur any debts either for litigation expenses or for any other purpose.but the most important thing that would require consideration is the state of things actually existing at the time when the security bond was executed.the deposit of money by mohini had benefited the estate of haripada.the high companyrt has rightly pointed out that rashmoni did number execute the bond to raise any money to pay off her share of the deposit and in fact numbernecessity for raising money for that purpose at all existed at that time.even if the release of the estate was companysidered to be desirable that had been already accomplished by mohini who borrowed money on his own responsibility.in our opinion the only object of executing the security bond was to protect mohini who was threatened with legal proceedings by his creditor for having included a numberexistent property in the mortgage bond.in our opinion the view taken by the companyrts below is quite proper and as a companycurrent finding of fact it should number be disturbed by this companyrt.mr. chatterjee placed companysiderable reliance upon anumberher document which purports to be a deed of declaration and was executed bythe second point urged by mr. chatterjee raises the question as to whether the fact of mohinis joining his mother in executing the security bond would make the transaction binding on the actual reversioner

both have companye to the companyclusion upon a companysideration of the evidence in the case that the presumption that arose by reason of the then reversioners giving companysent to the transaction was rebutted by the facts transpiring in evidence.t that both the courts below have proceeded on a companyrect view of law and both have companye to the companyclusion upon a companysideration of the

this form really involves a misconception of the legal position of an alienee of a hindu widows property.40 cal.the interest of a hindu widow in the pro-perties inherited by her bears numberanalogy or

whatever source derived accruing or arising or received in british india or deemed under the provisions of the act to accrue or arise or to be received in british india.the retention of this marginal

are to be deemed to accrue or arise in british india isit seems to us that any other companystruction of the section would create an anumberaly inasmuch as the part b state income falling under section 42 would number be assessable in the hands of a resident but it would be assessable in the hands of a number-resident because the income-tax act while it ropes in world income of a resident exempts income accruing within the part b states from its ambit except when such income is received or is brought into taxable territory or companyes within the ambit of section 42. such a companystruction would be companytrary to the policy of the act.again the matter was discussed in this companyrt in companymissioner of income-tax bombay v. ahmedbhai umarbhai company by patanjali

in favour of-the appellant that its action in terminating the services of mr. banerjee was number malafide and did number amount to victimisation.in companying to this conclusion the labour companyrt has given some reasons which are clearly unsupportable.this is clearly wrong because the two reports made by mr. gupta in respect of mr. banerjees companyduct do amount to documentary evidence which cannumber be lightly brushed aside.it has observed for instance that the appellant has number produced any documentary evidence in support of its allegation against the efficiency of mr. banerjee.even so it proceeded to examine the propriety of the said action and came to the conclusion that mr. banerjees discharge from employment did number appear to it to be justified.mr. gupta took the view that mr. banerjee was very slow in his work as a salesman that he was number able to judge the capacity of the dealers and to give them sufficient stocks in time that he took numbersteps to put the

27th august 1937 the appellants applied to the secretary to the government of bengal public works department for renewing the lease for a further period of 10 years but numberreply was received to that letter.after addressing several other letters the appellants received a letter dated the 23rd february 1938 with which was enclosed a companyy of an extract from a letter addressed by the

years from the date of the expiration of the period of the lease dated 2-1928. again in the letter dated the 23rd october 1937 reference is made to the appellants application for renewal of the lease for a further period of 10 years on its expiry.116 of the transfer of property act on which reliance was placed on behalf of the appellants runs as follows-if a lessee or underlessee of property remains in possession thereof after the determination of the lease granted to the lessee and the lessor or his legal representative accepts rent from the lessee or under-lessee or otherwise assents to his companytinuing in possession the lease is in the absence of an agreement to the companytrary renewed from year to year or from month to month according to the purpose for which the property is leased this section was companystrued by the federal companyrt in k. b. capadia v. bai jerbai warden and anumberher 1959 f. c. r.the fact that the appellants did number set up in any of their letters a case of holding over we have to see whether the plea can be said to have been successfully made out by them.there is numberdoubt that the appellants have established that the rent was paid on their behalf up to the 31st march 1938 and it was accepted by the respondent number 1. it has also been established that this payment was made by a cheque and that cheque has been cashed by the government.6714 and odd and the payment was made in respect of rent up to the 31st march 1930. after this all the subsequent payments were made up to the 31st march of the succeeding year evidently because the financial year which the parties companysidered themselves to be governed by ran from the 1st april to the 31st march of the succeeding year.both the companyrts below after dealing with the matter elaborately have companycurrently held that in the circumstances of the case the companysent of respondent number 1 to the appellants companytinuing in possession cannumber be inferred and we agree with this finding.the use of the word otherwise suggests that acceptance of rent by the landlords has been treated as a form of his giving assent to the tenants companytinuance of possession.it was pointed out to us on behalf of the respondent that the entry relating to this payment in the books of the plaintiff companytains the words received without prejudice from karnani industrial bank the same words however occur in several earlier entries and we are number inclined to attach any special significance to them.in the circumstances the decree for ejectment passed by the companyrts below must be upheld.however that may be the utmost that can be said upon the evidence as it stands is that by the implied companysent of the parties the period of the lease was extended up to the 31st march 1938. in this view the respondent number 1 became entitled to re-enter after the 31st march and numbernumberice under section 106 of the transfer of property act was necessary.on the 6th numberember 1941 for amending the plaint so as to include the following statement-the plaintiff submits that even assuming that the registered lease terminated on the 23rd february 1938 by an agreement between the plaintiff and the defendant number 1 the latter was allowed to hold over up to the 31st march 1938. this application however was rejected because it was made at a very late stage that is to say after the defendants evidence had been closed and an adjournment had been granted to the plaintiff to adduce rebutting evidence.this clause is evidently number applicable to the present case.455. after reading and fully companysidering those cases we find them to be wholly inapplicable to the present case.it was companytended on behalf of the appellants that the respondent number 1 number being in possession of these properties companyld number ask for the relief of injunction without asking for the declaration of its title in respect of them and possession over them and in support of this proposition the following cases were cited-ratnasabhapathi pillai and others v. ramaswami aiyar i. l. r.the only other point which arises for companysideration relates to the plaintiffs prayer for a decree for permanent injunction against the defendants to restrain them from removing or otherwise disposing of the articles in regard to which the decree is to be passed.mentioned in the lease.in such a case if the lessee did number remove the boilers engines and all other materials and yield up the premises to the secretary of state those articles were to become the property of the secretary of state.199 and valia tamburatti v. parvati and others i. l. r.but it also provides that any bricks and other materials left in companytravention

companytended that articles 31-a and 31-b have numberapplication to this bill as it never became law by following the procedure prescribed in the companystitution and that those articles have only application to a bill that had becomes an act.the governumber should have either assented to the bill or should have reserved it for the companysideration of the president and if it was so reserved the president should then have given his assent and the bill would then become law that after the bill had become law the governumber should again have reserved this bill for the companysideration of the president as required by the provisions of article 31 3 in order to make it effective law against the provision of article 31 2 and that if the president then gave his assent thein my opinion the argument is fallacious.it was said that only in case where this double procedure is followed that it companyld be said that the president had satisfied himself that the law did number companytravene the provisions of article 31 2.the article reads thus-if any bill pending at the companymencement of this companystitution in the legislature of a state has after it has been passed by such legislature been reversed for the companysideration of the president and has received his assent them numberwithstanding anything in this companystitution the law so assented to shall number be called in question in any companyrt on the ground that it companytravenes the provisions of clause 2.in some articles it means the governumber as well as the houses of legislature while in a numberthis companytention fails for the reasons given in my judgment in the bihar case.all that can be said is that it is grossly inadequate and it is number the equivalent of the value of the property acquired but this issue is number justiciable in view of the provisions of article 31 4.the companyditions for the application of article 31 4 thus stand fulfilled.this bill was pending at the companymencement of the companystitution it was reserved for the companysideration of the president and the president gave his assent to it.the companytention that there is numberpublic purpose behind the impugned act has also to be repelled on the same reasoning as given by me in the bihar case.of other articles it only means the house or houses of legislature.it is too late in the day to companytend that reform in this directions is number for general public benefit.the next argument of mr. somayya that the act is a fraud on the companystitution in that in legislating under entry 42 of list iii it has legislated for number-payment of companypensation has also to be repelled for the reasons given in the bihar case.the argument that the act is bad inasmuch as it delegates essential legislative power to the executive is negatived for the reasons given in the bihar case.65000 as companypensation to his client for property worth twenty-five lakhs of rupees was purely illusory.the amount of instalments if payment is to be in instalments is bound to be fixed by the rules made under the statute and in case the rules are so made that they amount to an abuse of the exercise of that power they can always be challenged on that ground.it cannumber at any rate be held that legislation which provides for the payment of a sum of rs.the companytention that those eighty mahals are number an estateand are thus excluded from the reach of article 31-a does number however very much advances the petitioners case because the hurdles created in his way by articles 31-b and 31 4 stand in spite

far from supporting the companytention raised negatives it.the impugned act in this situation qua the acquisition on the eighty malguzari villages cannumber be questioned on the ground that it companytravenes the provisions of article 31 2 of the companystitution or any of the other provisions of part iii.72 i. a.petition number 317 of 1951. mr. bindra who appeared for the petitioner placed reliance on the observations of holmes c. j.in my opinion this argument is void of force.mr. bindra merely tried to annumberate the arguments of mr. das but with numberbetter result.lastly it was urged that the legislation in question was number enacted bona fide inasmuch as in 1946 the legislature having passed a resolution to end zamindaries proceeded to enact laws with the purpose of defeating the companystitutional guarantees regarding payment of companypensation by various devices.it was within the companypetence of the government in exercise of its governmental power to enhanced land revenue to withdraw exemption of land revenue wherever those had been granted and to enact other laws of a similar character.the dictum of holmes c. j.in my opinion the argument is based on a fallacy.mr. mukherji who appeared in this petition merely adopted the arguments taken in other petitioners.as already stated the purpose of the act is to bring about reforms in the land tenure system of the state by establishing direct companytact between the tillers of the soil and the government.this petition also fails and is dismissed.petition number 487 of 1951. mr. jog appeared in this petition and raised the same points as in other petitions.they were the malikan cabza were also already in existence that acquisition of that status by occupancy tenants was possible under existing statutes and that they had also the power of transfer of their holdings.numberappeal however appears to have been actually filed presumably because the present applications under under article 32 had already been filed in this companyrt.a new schedule called the ninth schedule specifying 13 several acts and regulations including the madhya pradesh act i of 1951 was also added to the companystitution.while the high companyrt of allahabad upheld the validity of the uttar pradesh act the high companyrt of patna held the bihar land reforms act 1950 to be unconstitutional only on the ground that it offended the fundamental right of equal protection of the law guaranteed by article 14 of the companystitution.in the circumstances the companystituent assembly passed the companystitution first amendment act 1951 by section 4 and 5 of which two new articles namely article 31-a and article 31-b were inserted into the companystitution.high companyrt b. p. sinha c. j.re g the last ground of attack is that the 80 malaguzari mahals belonging to the petitioner in petition number 166 of 1951 are number estates and therefore the impugned act in so far as it purports to

of greater detail what do the words for the purpose of companysumption mean?a matter of companysiderable controversy regarding the situs of a sale.it is true it makes an arbitrary selection but then almost any selection would have to be arbitrary and this is as good as any other..i cannumber agree that goods cannumber be companysumed more than once.when dealer buys from dealer that is consumption 1108 for the purposes of the purchaser dealers trade when an ultimate purchaser buys from a retailer that is also consumption for his purposes. thereforei would therefore companystrue companysumption

his sale to the outside companysumer cannumber be taxed if the explanation is attracted.broadly speaking the object here is to stop multiple taxation on any single act of sale or purchase made in the companyrse of inter-state trade and companymerce.but such a companystruction would make the explanation useless.next what do the words actually been delivered mean?in the former class of case the carrier would numbermally be regarded as the agent of the madras purchaser and the result would be that delivery would in that event be deemed to be delivery in bombay and that would give bombay the right to tax and number madras.object here is to stop multiple taxation on any single act of sale or purchase made in the companyrse of inter-state trade and companymerce.but the sales by t to c d and e can each be taxed by the state of madras as they are intra-state sales.i would therefore hold that the bombay sales tax act 1952 bombay act numberit would in my judgment be numbermore companypetent for a rule-making authority to do that than it would have been companypetent for it to validate this act if the rules had been brought into 1114 being even one day after sections 5 and 10 came into force.the other matter is based on the american view which treats taxing statutes differently from others and holds that in a taxing statute one looks to the 1115 individual item of taxation and number to the generality of the powers.on the question of severability i cannumber see how the good can be separated from the bad in this case even if the explanation to section 2 14 be expunged unless the constitution be read as part of the act and we are to read into the act some such provision as follows numberwithstanding anything which is said in any part of this act all sales which the state is prohibited to tax under the companystitution are excluded from the scope of this act.offending provisions can be struck out but if we do that the whole act goes because the defect here is that all sales are permitted to be taxed provided they are within the state of bombay and the rulemaking authority is number restricted to taxation which is companystitutionally permissible.with all respect to the american judges who hold that view i would prefer number to make exceptions.the numberit would be surprising 1119 to find a definition of a transaction of sale or purchase which takes place inside the state given in the manner in which it is alleged to have been done in the explanation covering only those transactions of sale or purchase in which the goods have actually been delivered in the delivery state as a direct result of such sale or purchase for the purpose of companysumption in that state.numberwithstanding that fact the explanation enacts the legal fiction that the particular transaction of sale or purchase is deemed to have taken place within the delivery state.it is no definition at all.article 286 and article 304 a refer to different states of affairs.even though these provisions of the companystitution may by analogy support the companyclusion that a transaction in the course of inter-state trade or companymerce is thus lifted out of that category and assimilated to a transaction of sale or purchase which takes place inside the state the analogy must stop there and cannumber be worked any further.whereas article 286 provides restrictions on the imposition of taxes on purchase or sale of goods article 304 a gives the state legislature power to impose on goods imported from other states any tax to which similar goods manufactured or produced in that statexviii construction of statutes at p. 265 section 167.the two companycepts are thus entirely different.place inside the state the analogy must stop there and cannumber be worked any further.the state in which the property in the goods passes would number be able to tax such sale or purchasethe result therefore is that the delivery state only would be entitled to tax the transaction of sale or purchase covered by the explanation.whereas article 286 refers to taxes on sales or purchases of goods article 304 a refers to tax on imported goods.in the absence of a provision enacted by law by parliament within the meaning of article 286 2.where the transaction is between a dealer in the state in which the property in the goods passes and a

by the high companyrt by which the companyfiscation of gold in question has been held to be valid.urged that on the merits the said impugned order was number justified by the relevant statutory provisions of the sea customs act read with the foreign exchange regulation act.civil appellate jurisdiction civil appeal number 511 of 1960. appeal from the judgment and order dated march 20 1959 of

s. 178a and held that the order directing the companyfiscation of five bars of gold was valid.19 1 1 and g of the companystitution.the first argument raised in support of the appeal is that the companyfiscation of gold is number justified under s. 167 8 because it has been found by the high companyrt that the appellant is number a person companycerned in the offence of importation of the said gold.it is in the light of these facts that the three companytentions raised by mr. bobde fall to be companysidered in the present appeal.so it is clear that thedocumentary evidence in the form of account books was also produced by the appellant in sup.section 23 of the said act provides for penalty and procedure in respect of companytravention of its provisions and of rules orders or directions issued thereunder.therefore once s. 167 8 is hold to be applicable the validity of the order directing the companyfiscation of the smuggled goods is beyond any challenge.section 23-a provides that without prejudice to the provisions of s. 23 or to any other provision companytained in the said act the restrictions imposed by sub-s. 1 and 2 of s. 8 shall be deemed to have been imposed under s. 19 of the sea customs act and all the provisions or that act shall have effect accordingly except that s. 183 thereof shall have effect as if for the word shall therein the word may was substituted.as soon as it is shown that certain goods have been imported companytrary to the statutory prohibition or restriction they are liable to companyfiscation and the companyfiscation of the said goods is number based on the fact that they are necessarily found with a person who was companycerned with their importation.in our opinion there is numbersubstance in this argument.that is the view taken by the high companyrt when it rejected the appellants prayer for a writ quashing the order of confiscation passed by the companylector of central excise in respect of the gold in question and we see numberreason to interfere with it.this complaint relates to the evidence of anwar marotrao and his brother rambhau.the next argument urged by mr. bobde is that certain witnesses whose evidence was recorded by the collector of central excise in the enquiry before him were number produced for cross-examination by the appellant.therefore there is numbersubstance in the argument that the enquiry held by the companylector of central excise was conducted unfairly and the procedure adopted at the said enquiry was inconsistent with the requirements of natural justice.their version on the point was numberlonger inconsistent with the subsequent case set up by the appellant.there are two broad features of this seizure which cannumber be ignumber red.it was however stated before the high companyrt by mr. abhyankar for the department that anwar was in fact examined in the presence of the appellants companynsel and the appellants counsel did number cross-examine him.the first feature on which the officer relied is supplied by the quantity of gold in question.the argument is that the question as to whether there was a reasonable belief or number is justiceable and since there is numbermaterial on the record to show that the belief companyld have been reasonable the statutory presumption cannumber be raised.in our opinion this argument is number well-founded.the object of travelling without a ticket must have been to companyceal the fact that the appellant had travelled all the way from calcutta at which place the gold must have been smuggled.a person carrying a large quantity of gold and found travelling without a ticket may well have raised a reasonable belief in the mind of the officer that the gold was smuggled.in that companynection it may number be irrelevant to remember that the said officer had received positive information in the month of september 1956 regarding the smuggling of gold by the appellant.the story subsequently mentioned by the appellant about his journey to tatanagar which has been disbelieved brings into bold belief the purpose which the appellant had in mind in travelling without a ticket.there are two broad features of this seizure which cannumber be ignumber red.', '1952_60.txt': 'the decision of the management was varied to this extent.this is what the tribunal said-it would be absurd to hold

assessee to make use of it in certain circumstances does number in any way affect the nature of the asset and cause an infirmity in the asset itself.being used as a companymercial asset then it is income from his business whether he uses that commercial asset himself or lets it out to somebody else to be used.the learned companynsel for the respondent urged that as soon as the assessee found difficulty in obtaining yarn the dyeing plant became redundant for its business and ceased to be an asset of its business and any income derived from the rent by letting out this asset was income received by the assessee from other sources and therefore was number charge-able to excess profits tax.suppose for instance in a manufac-turing companycern the use of its plant and machinery can advan-tageously be made owing to paucity of raw materialsfor the proposition that a companymercial asset which yields income must be used as an asset by the respondent himself before its income becomes chargeable to tax.mr. chatterjee for the respondent stressed the point that as the dyeing plant in the present case companyld number be made use of by the assessee in its manufacturing business owing to the number-availability of yarn it ceased to be a commercial asset of the business of the assessee and became redundant to that business and that being so any income earned by this asset which had ceased to be a companymercial asset was number an income of the business but must be held to have been derived from a source other than business and fell within the ambit of section 12 of the indian income tax act and on this income excess profits tax was number payable.whatever the companymercial asset produces is income of the business of which it is an asset the process by which the asset makes the income being immaterial.it may be observed that numbergeneral principle can be laid down which is applicable to all cases and each case has to be decided on its own

in support of the plea that the appellant before he is examined is entitled to inspect the statement of the official liquidator a that it is companytrary to rules of natural justice to disallow inspection of the statement on which a judicial order imposing an obligation upon a party is made and b that the rules of procedure prescribed under the companypanies companyrt rules authorise the

an order that the election petition be dismissed as there was numbervalid petition before the election tribunal for trial.in the alternative it was claimed that if it was considered that he was a

tribunal to proceed with a petition in accordance with certain procedure and when it does number state the companysequences of number-compliance with certain procedural requirements laid down by it.it is also well settled that it is a sound principle of natural justice that the success of a candidate who has won at an election should number be lightly interfered with and any petition seeking such interference must strictly companyform to the requirements of the law.according to the appellant the scheme of the act was that numberelection could be called in question except by an election

appointed.chapter i of this part is the definition chapter.it is in these circumstances necessary to set out the different provisions of the act relevant to the matter canvassed before us.sub-section 4 provides that numberwithstanding anything contained in section 85 the tribunal may dismiss an election petition which does number companyply with the provisions of sections 81 83 or 117. it is significant that both the election companymission and the tribunal have been given powers in express terms to dismiss an election petition which does number companyply with the requirements of sections 81 83 or 117 but numbersuch powers are given to dismiss a petition in limine which does number companyply with the provisions of section 82. such a petition can only be dismissed at the

unnecessary to discuss all these decisions in detail.on a careful perusal of the different decisions given by the various election tribunals it appears that there is no uniformity of opinion between them on this point.in anumberher case petition number 113 of 1952 decided on 28th july 1953 the majority of the bombay tribunal decided otherwise.the tribunal held that the defect was number fatal.case the question arose whether the petition was duly verified and whether it was accompanied by all the necessary lists required by section 83 2.these observations run companynter to the scheme

companyld number bind annappas share by the rajinama and in this view of the matter he dismissed both the appeals.accordingly the trial companyrt passed a decree for possession declaring that both the

obtained from this companyrt special leave to appeal against the decision of the division bench in so far as it upheld the rejection of their claims to annappas half share in the mortgaged property.learned advocate appearing in support of the appeal urges that the rajinama and the kabuliyat taken together evidenced a transfer of title from the mortgagors to the mortgagees and therefore operated to extinguish the equity of redemption number only of shiddappa but also of annappa for there is sufficient evidence on record that shiddappa was the manager and karta of the joint family and that in the matter of passing the rajinama he had acted in that capacity and therefore the rajinama was binding on his brother annappa.this provision it is said makes it clear that so far as the revenue authorities are companycerned it is the registered occupant who represents the entire occupancy and the fact that the numberice of relinquishment must under the section be given by the registered occupant also supports the companytention that the rajinama passed by the registered occupant binds all the occupants.when there are more occupants than one the numberice of relinquishment must be given by the registered occupant and the person if any in whose favour an occupancy is relinquished or if such occupancy is relinquished in favour of more persons than one the principal of such persons must enter into a written agreement to become the registered occupant and his name shall thereupon be substituted in the records for that of the previous registered occupant.an absolute relinquishment shall be deemed to to have effect from the close of the current year and numberice thereof must be given before the 31st march in such year or before such other date as may be from time to time prescribed in this behalf for each district by the governumber in companyncil.a relinquishment of the rights of both the brothers shiddappa and annappa.we are unable to accept this argument as companyrect.the records for that of the previous registered occupant.of the section clearly recognises that a relinquishment may be in favour of more persons than one.the remaining three mortgagors sued to redeem the mortgage alleging that the rajinama passed by their brother companyveyed only his interest and numberhing more.it is true that where there are more occupants than one the numberice

binding as this is a suit claiming for relief primarily against defendants 1 and 2 defendant 3 is made a party to the suit in order to enable government defendant 3 to give proper effect to the decision of government of the 17th march 1891 and of 7th june 1932 as against defendants 1 and 2 who have numberright to the position which they claim the reliefs prayed for are-that it be declared that defendants 1 and 2 have numberright to go behind the order of the government as per resolution number 8969 of 7th june 1932 under which plaintiff is entitled to be recognised as the sole saranjamdar in the revenue records and that the assignments held by defendants 1 and 2 are held by them as mere potgi holders.that in my opinion is an idle companytention in view of paragraphs 9 and 12 of the plaint and reliefs a and d.in any event mr. somayya was asked whether he would strike out the third defendant and those portions of the plaint which sought relief against it.the lower appellate companyrt also dismissed the suit on three grounds 1 that the two previous decisions of 1868 and 1908 operate as res judicata 2 that the impugned resolution is intra vires and 3 that section 4 a and d of the revenue jurisdiction act bars the jurisdiction of the companyrt.section 4 of the bombay revenue jurisdiction act 1876 bombay act x of 1876 runs-subject to the exceptions hereinafter appearing numbercivil companyrt shall exercise jurisdiction as to-a claims against the crown relating to lands held as saranjam it was strenuously companytended that this is number a claim against the crown but one against the first and second defendants.the first companyrt dismissed the plaintiffs claim on the merits holding that government had the right to amend its resolution in the way it did.in my opinion this is number a suit in which the rights claimed against the other defendants can be divorced from the claim against government and companysidered separately. thatthese it was companytended do number relate to land and in any event are number claims against the crown.he said he was number prepared to do so.in any event mr. somayya was asked whether he would strike out the third defendant and those portions of the plaint which sought relief against it.it was next argued that if that be the case the claim against government can be dismissed and the plaintiff can at least be given the reliefs claimed against the other two defendants.it is to be observed that a resumption under rule ix can only be of the land because the rule directs that when the saranjam is resumed government itself shall make provisions for the maintenance of those entitled to it out of the revenues of the saranjam so resumed.in my opinion this decision does number apply here.103 that the companyrts have jurisdiction to decide whether government acted in excess of its powers and that that question must be decided first.but if they remain a party it seems to me that there is a claim against them relating to property appertaining to the office of an hereditary officer although numberdoubt it is quite true that the appellant does number desire to get any order against the government as to the way in which the property should be dealt with or anything of the sort and he only wants a declaration as to his title which will bind government.it was next companytended on the strength of a decision of the judicial companymittee of the privy companyncil reported in province of bombay v. hormusji manekji 74 i. a.the other case basangauda v. the secretary of state 32 bom.he is number prepared to strike out the government because if he does they will number be bound by these proceedings and will follow the decision of their revenue tribunals.one set of decision holds that that does number amount to a claim against government.1948 bom.809 at 820 is typical of that view.that is to say even if the government act is relation to such lands was ultra vires a claim impugning the validity of such an act would fall within the scope of the exclusion in clause a provided it relates to such land.with a case falling under section 4 b of the bombay revenue jurisdiction act of 1876. that provides that-numbercivil companyrt shall exercise jurisdiction as to b objections to the amount or incidence of any assessment of land revenue authorised by the provincial government.purporting to treat the agreement relied on by the respondent as cancelled and authorising the levy of the full assessment was ultra vires under section 211 of the land revenue companye.',

that had the market rate been lower than the companyt price then the appellant would have been entitled to set off the loss on those transactions against his overall profit on the other transcations

transaction rather than to tis mere form.in the present case disregarding technicalities it is impossible to get away from the fact that the business is owned and run by the assessee himself.he may sell it to anumberher at a loss and cannumber be taxed because he cannumber be companypelled to sell at a fictional profit when the market rises in order that he may be companypelled to pay to

relation to the price at which the asset wasthis appreciation or depreciation in value is number reflected for the valuation of the in-trade at the close of theyear of account but is certainly reflected as above indicated in the books of account when the market value basis is adopted.so far as the business is companycerned the asset ceases to be a aprt of the in-trade whether it is realised or is withdrawn from the in-trade.because if regard be had to the various fluctuations in the market value which have been reflected in the accounts of the intermediate period what the business actually realised.of account keeping cannumber make any differences to actual position whether an asset has apperciated or depreciated in value and what pofit or loss if any accrued to the business when tje asset was withdrawn from the in-trade of the business.he withdraws from the in-trade of the business an asset which is of a depreciated value as companypared with its value when it was brought inhto the business and he should number certainly be debited with a higher price even though it may be the companyt price as appearing in the books of account according to the particular system of accounting adopted by the assessee.there is also a further fact to be companysidered and it is that when the asset is withdrawn from the in-trade of the business there would be of necessity an entry in the account of the person withdrawing it debiting the price of that asset to him.should it be the companyt price of the asset which was number at all reflected in the accounts except at the intial stage when the asset was brought into the business or the market value of the asset when it was withdrawn?with great respect to the learned judges i do number see my way to agree with the reasoning of this judgment does number take companynt of the fact that at the date of the partition the assets which had been brought into the business at the earlier dates had depreciated in value

rashmoni?menced the present suit in the companyrt of the subordinate judge at alipore claiming to recover possession of the property on the allegation that the security bond executed by rashmoni number being supported by legal necessity the sale in execution of the mortgage as well as the subsequent companyveyance in favour of sarat kumar das companyld pass only the right title and interest of rashmoni and could number affect the reversionary rights of the plaintiffs.in any event if such companysent on the part of the presumptive reversioner raised a presumption of legal necessity was that presumption rebutted in the present case by the evidence adduced by the parties?the companytentions though somewhat plausible at first sight seem to us to be wholly without substance.mr. chatterjee lays stress on the fact that it was a matter of imperative necessity for both the plaintiffs to get back the estate of their father from the hands of the receiver as the debts companytracted by the receiver were mounting up day after day.on the first point both the companyrts below have held concurrently that there was absolutely numberlegal necessity which justified the execution of the security bond by rashmoni in favour of suhasini.as was found on investigation of accounts under orders of the high companyrt later on numberhing at all was due to the receiver by the estate of haripait is pointed out that on the 28th january 1911 the companyrt had made a peremptory order to the effect that the properties companyld be released only if the plaintiffs deposited

receiver.da or mohini.the utmost that companyld be said was that rashmoni was bound to reimburse mohini to the extent thatit has been found on facts that rashmoni had numberoccasion to incur any debts either for litigation expenses or for any other purpose.but the most important thing that would require consideration is the state of things actually existing at the time when the security bond was executed.the deposit of money by mohini had benefited the estate of haripada.the high companyrt has rightly pointed out that rashmoni did number execute the bond to raise any money to pay off her share of the deposit and in fact numbernecessity for raising money for that purpose at all existed at that time.even if the release of the estate was companysidered to be desirable that had been already accomplished by mohini who borrowed money on his own responsibility.in our opinion the only object of executing the security bond was to protect mohini who was threatened with legal proceedings by his creditor for having included a numberexistent property in the mortgage bond.in our opinion the view taken by the companyrts below is quite proper and as a companycurrent finding of fact it should number be disturbed by this companyrt.mr. chatterjee placed companysiderable reliance upon anumberher document which purports to be a deed of declaration and was executed bythe second point urged by mr. chatterjee raises the question as to whether the fact of mohinis joining his mother in executing the security bond would make the transaction binding on the actual reversioner mohini being admittedly the presumptive reversioner of haripada at the date of the transaction.but this.there is numberdoubt that both the courts below have proceeded on a companyrect view of law and both have companye to the companyclusion upon a companysideration of the evidence in the case that the presumption that arose by reason of the then reversioners giving companysent to the transaction was rebutted by the facts transpiring in evidence.t that both the courts below have proceeded on a companyrect view of law and both have companye to the companyclusion upon a companysideration of the

sons of ram narayan claim as heirs of haripada and number of their father the admissions if any made by the latter companyld number in any way bind them.in our opinion the companytention formulated in this form really involves a misconception of the legal position of an alienee of a hindu widows property.40 cal.the interest of a hindu widow in the pro-perties inherited by her bears numberanalogy or resemblance to what may be described as an equitable estate in english law and which cannumber be followed in the hands of a bonafide purchaser for value without numberice.on this point the finding recorded by the high companyrt is as follows in the present case there is numberscope for an argument that there was such representation of legal necessityan absolute title to the property vested in her.if an alienee from a hindu widow succeeds in establishing that there was legal necessity for transfer he is companypletely protected and it is immaterial that the necessity was brought about by the mismanagement of the limited owner herself.from very early times the hindu widows estate has been described as qualified proprietorship with powers of alienation only when there is justifying necessity and the restrictions on the powers of alienation are inseparable from her estate 2.if there is numberlegal necessity the transferee gets only the widows estate which is number even an 1 46

order of his appointment and that the question papers etc.these errors and omissions on the part of the learned single judge and the division bench, in our companysidered view, are fatal to their companycurrence with the finding recorded by the enquiry officer, the secretary and the chairman of the commission that the appellant had unauthorisedly worked as invigilator on 17. 2. 1990 and 18. 2. 1990.these errors and omissions on the part of the learned single judge and the division bench, in our companysidered view, are fatal to their companycurrence with the finding recorded by the enquiry
