that her jiwai had also been stopped.on march 20, 1948, the state of morvi became a part of the saurashtra union.she then made certain representations and after some conferences and some discussion a copy of the order of the political department was sent to the appellant in which it was stated that the village would be resumed and an amount calculated on the basis of average revenue of the village for 3 years would be paid to her as cash allowance for lifetime.of the immemorial tradition of this state the said village and the land etc., thereof have been granted to you in order to maintain your

workers were entitled to privilege leave and there was no provision in those rules similar to the one that has been made in section 49-b or in the new rules and that the mills had no right to deprive

addressed to, the appellant.in august, 1959, the said works despatched some wagons of pig iron to the appellant, but out of 20 wagons of the consignment, 14 were lost completely, and the rest misdelivered and were subsequently found somewhere in gomoh and some in tatanagar and they never reached the appellant in time.correspondence followed between the said companies and the appellant and finally in november, 1959, the appellant was informed by the said companies that they could not supply its requirements of raw material.in 1959, both the companies stopped supply of pig iron in spite of the order issued in that behalf by the controller, and they wrote to the appellant suggesting that the appellant should request the controller to cancel his order and place the same with some other suppliers.formerly, supply of pig iron used to come from the said two concerns to the appellant and the appellant used to pay cash to tata iron steel co. ltd. for the pig iron supplied by it and by a letter of credit to the indian iron steel co. ltd. on which the said company used to supply the raw material made by it.in august, there was a supply of 440 tons and in september, followed a supply of

appellant.in fact, the general manager categorically stated that the appellant had not casted anynow, if this contention had been established then it would clearly have been a case of malafides on the part of the appellant and a claim for additional compensation may have been justified.the argument was that at belur, the appellant gets its work done at cheaper cost with the help of contract labour.that, in short, is the background of the lay-off, the validity of which formed the subject-matter of the present reference.this lay-off con-tinued until september, 11, 1960 and from september

resident in india, section 42 could not be invoked in the case, because that section had application only to cases of non-resident.the retention of this marginal note gave rise to conflicting decision

in the same termes.it is significant that the changes made in section 42 in the year 1939 were consequential to the entire recasting of section 4 of the act.by statutory fiction income which can in no

assessable in the hands of a resident, but it would be assessable in the hands of a non-resident, because the income-tax act, while it ropes in world income of a resident exempts income accruing within the part b states from its ambit, except when such income is received or is brought into taxable territory or comes within the ambit of section 42.in sutlej cotton mills ltd. v. commissioner of

well as non-residents.again the matter was discussed in this court in commissioner of income-tax, bombay v. ahmedbhai umarbhai co., by patanjali sastri, j., as he then was, andwherever the legislature intended to limit the operation of any part of this section to non-residents alone, it said so in express terms.though reference was made in that case to the alteration in the structure of sub-section( i) its significance, as it seems to me, was not properly appreciated.the facts that the marginal note to the whole section refers to non-residents and that the section itself finds a place in chapter v headed liability in special cases were relied upon as supporting the view that sub-section( i) as a whole applies only to non-residents.before its amendment in 1939 the sub-section began with the words in the case of any person residing out of british india which obviously restricted the application of the provision to non-resident persons, but in its amended form the sub-section has been recast into two distinct parts, the first of which is not so restricted, and the second part alone, which begins with the words and where the person entitled to the income, profits and gains is not resident in british india, is made applicable to non-resident persons, thereby showing that the former part applies to both residents and non-residents.decision the sub-sections( 1) and( 3) of section 42 covered cases of both residents as well as non-residents.for the reasons given above we are of the opinion that the answer re turned by the high court of bombay

making the sales of hides and skins liable to taxation at a single point but that, as the opening words of the section show, is subject to restrictions and conditions prescribed in the rules and one of these conditions is the taking of a licence.the rule, which deals with licences is r. 5 of the sales tax rules, the relevant portion of which has already been set out it lays down that if a dealer

unemployed, there is some force also in the argument that it is neither just nor fair to treat these unfortunate people as the special responsibility of the particular industry or the factory where they are seasonally employed.while these considerations on either side are common to claims for retaining allowance for all seasonal workmen in all industries, the special facts and circumstances of

court was delivered by gajendragadkar j.--mr.the labour court which tried the dispute came to the conclusion that the appellant had failed to justify the discharge of mr. banerjee and so, it has directed the appellant to reinstate him and pay him full emoluments from the date of his discharge up to the date of his reinstatement.on december 5, 1959, his services were terminated and he was informed that the appellant had lost confidence in him, and so, it bad decided to discharge him.accordingly, in lieu of notice, he was paid a months salary and was told that he ceased to be the employee of the appe-llant as from the date next after he received the order from the appellant.r. k. banerjee had been employed by the appellant, the tata oil mills co. ltd. as a salesman on april 3, 1956, as a probationer and he was confirmed on november 5, 1956.since the dispute could not be settled amicably, the union succeeded in persuading the government of west bengal to refer the dispute for adjudication to the second labour court on the ground that the said discharge was not justified.that, in brief, is thethe material facts leading to the termination of mr. banerjees services lie within a very narrow compass.the head ice accepted this report and on december 5, 1959, issued to mr, banerjee the order terminating his services.the head ice then instructed the calcutta sales ice by telephone to send for mr. banerjee and call for his explanation.the appellant has a sales ice in calcutta and the manager of the said ice visits the areas within his jurisdiction to inspect the work of salesmen.thereupon, mr. gupta made a report to the zonal manager on november 2, 1959, adversely commenting on mr. banerjees work.basing themselves on the plea that the discharge amounted to dismissal, the respondents pleaded that the failure of the appellant to hold an enquiry against mr. banerjee introduced a serious infirmity in the order passed against him and they argued that the conduct of the appellant was malafide and the dismissal of mr. banerjee amounted to victimisation.the head ice accepted this report and on december 5, 1959, issued to mr, banerjee the order terminating his services.for mr. banerjee and call for his explanation.accordingly, mr. banerjee was sent for and his explanation taken mr. gupta then made another report expressing his dissatisfaction with the explanation given by mr. banerjee.the labour court has found that according to the terms of contract under which mr. banerjee was employed by the appellant, the appellant was entitled to discharge mr. banerjee from its employment under rule 40( 1) of the service rules but it held that merely because the order served on mr. banerjee purported to be an order of discharge, that would not exclude the jurisdiction of the labour court to examine the substance of the matter.in coming to this conclusion, the labour court has given some reasons which are clearly unsupportable.even so, it proceeded to examine the propriety of the said action and came to the conclusion that mr. banerjees discharge from employment did not appear to it to be justified.this is clearly wrong because the two reports made by mr. gupta in respect of mr. banerjees conduct do amount to documentary evidence which cannot be lightly brushed aside.it has observed, for instance, that the appellant has not produced any documentary evidence in support of its allegation against the efficiency of mr. banerjee.it has then commented on the fact that the allegations made by mr. gupta against mr. banerjee on six counts are of a general character.this position was recognised by the labour appellate tribunal as early as 1951 in buckingham and carnatic co. ltd., v. workers of the company,( 1), and since then, it has been consistently followed vide chartered bank, bombay, v. chartered bank employees union( 2), and u.similarly, the labour court has accepted the fact that mr. gupta that called for and received mr. banerjees explanation and to that extent it has rejected mr. banerjee suggestion that he had not given any explanation a all but even so, the labour court has not considered the effect of this conclusion on the main controversy between the parties.mr. gupta took the view that mr. banerjee was very slow in his work as a salesman, that he was not able to judge the capacity of the dealers and to give them sufficient stocks in time, that he took no steps to put the products of the appellant on prominent view in the dealers shops, that he wag not looking after the past374. to the zonal ice, the labour court has observed that on this point there is the evidence of mr. banerjee against that of mr. gupta and there was no particular reason to believe one in preference to the other.in our opinion, therefore, the-reasons given by the labour court in support of its conclusion that the discharge of mr. banerjee was not justified are wholly unsatisfactory and so, it has become necessary for us to examine the evidence ourselves.these defects are specific and it is idle to refuse to give importance to this evidence merely on the ground that no specific instances had been cited.banerjees work and there is no reason, whatever, why the labour court should have been reluctant to accept this report.gupta expressly states six grounds on which mr. banerjees work was found to be unsatisfactory.when he was asked how that could be done, he agreed that the metal straps had to be removed for opening of the boxes, but he added that he had arranged to have them restrapped and nailed.ing of the posters, in fact in one place the poster was pasted upside down, that he was not educating the stockists and dealers as he could have done and that he was reluctant to put hard and intelligent work.it is remarkable that when mr. banerjee was asked about this report in cross-examination, he frankly stated that mr. gupta was not unfriendly towards him and he was really unable to say why mr. gupta should have made these adverse comments against his work.think that the answers given by mr. gupta in respect of these letters can be of any assistance to the respondents in discrediting mr. guptas evidence in any manner.on the whole, we have no hesitation in holding that the appellant acted bonafide in discharging mr. banerjees services when it accepted mr. guptas report and concurred with his conclusions that the explanation given by mr. banerjee was not satisfactory.',\n"," '2013_30.txt': 'the gold chain was stolen but no complaint was lodged at

non-compliance with the provisions of section 82 is not fatal to the petition.it will be sufficient to say.the tribunal held that the defect was not fatal.the member of the tribunal who dissented from the majority view gave cogent and sound reasons for holding that non-joinder of a duly nominated candidate who has withdrawn was not necessarily fatal to the petition.in another case, petition no.was accompanied by all the necessary lists required by section 83( 2).these observations run counter to the scheme of the act itself as envisaged by section 85.113 of 1952, decided on 28th july, 1953, the majority of the bombay tribunal, decided otherwise.various provisions of the act referred to above show that the election petition does not necessarily abate or fail by reason of the death of the petitioner or any of the respondents or by their ceasing to take any interest in the trial of the petition once that petition has been referred to the tribunal.in our opinion the determination of the question whether the parties to the petition have been properly impleaded is a matter not for the election commission but for the tribunal.the, tribunal is given a similar power by section 90( 4).2017

therefore, the rajinama was binding on his brother annappa.we are unable to accept this argument as correct.it is true that the principal one of such persons must enter into a written agreement to become the registered occupant.an absolute relinquishment shall be deemed to to have effect from the close of the current year, and notice thereof must be given before the 31st march in such year, or before such other date as may be from time to time prescribed in this behalf for each district by the governor in council.code, as shiddappa was the registered occupant, the rajinama filed by him operated upon the entire occupancy and amounted to a relinquishment of the rights of both the brothers shiddappa and annappa.we are unable to accept this argument as correct.the concluding paragraph of the section clearly recognises that a relinquishment may be in favour of more persons than one.that does not mean, in the absence of any specific pleading and cogent proof, that a notice of relinquishment given by the registered occupant must necessarily be a notice on behalf of all occupants or any particular occupant other than the registered occupant, or that the registered occupant has the right to give such a notice without reference to the other occupants so as to effect their interest in the occupancy.that their right as occupants remains is clearly recognised by the opening paragraph of the section which gives an occupant a right to relinquish his occupancy either absolutely or in favour of a specified person.it was held that though the conveying brother was a co-mortgagor with the plaintiffs, he had no right to sell their interest in the equity of redemption and that, so far as they, were concerned, he was in the same position as an outsider.',\n","

presumption of legal necessity, was that presumption rebutted in the present case by the evidence adduced by the parties?mr. chatterjee lays stress on the fact that it was a matter of imperative necessity for both the plaintiffs to get back the estate of their father from the hands of the receiver as the debts contracted by the receiver were mounting up day after day.the contentions, though somewhat plausible at first sight, seem to us to be wholly without substance.it has been found on facts that rashmoni had no occasion to incur any debts either for litigation expenses or for any other purpose.not a mere moral obligation but a legal liability on the part of the lady, as mohini could have claimed contribution from her to the extent that haripadas estate was benefited by the deposit.this might furnish some excuse or explanation for mohinis borrowing money on the 28th january, 191 1, but that could not make the act of rashmoni in executing the security bond, seven months after that event, an act of prudent management on her part dictated either by legal necessity or considerations of benefit to the estate of her deceased son in the first place it is to be noted-that the total amount borrowed by mohini was rs.as was found, on investigation of accounts, under orders of the high court later on, nothing at all was due to the receiver by the estate of haripada or

fact no necessity for raising money for that purpose at all existed at that time.been already accomplished by mohini who borrowed money on his own responsibility.the utmost that could be said was that rashmoni was bound to reimburse mohini to the extent that the deposit of money by mohini had benefited the estate of haripada.undoubtedly the accounts were still to be investigated but what necessity there possibly could be for rashmoni to execute, after the high court had made the order as stated above, a security bond by which she mortgaged all the properties that were allotted to haripada in his share as an additional security for the entire loan of rs.the high court dispos-ed of the revision case on 29th may, 1611, and directed investigation into the accounts of the receiver by a commissioner appointed by it.mr. chatterjee placed considerable reliance upon another document which purports to be a deed of declaration and was executed by ram narayanthe second point urged by mr. chatterjee raises the question as to whether the fact of mohinis joining his mother in executing the security bond would make the transaction binding on the actual reversioner, mohini being admittedly the presumptive reversioner of haripada at the date of the transaction.the alienation here, was by way of mortgage and so no question of surrender could possibly arise.in our opinion the view taken by the courts below is quite proper and as a concurrent finding of fact it should not be disturbed by this court.there is no doubt that both the courts below have proceeded on a correct view of law and both have come to the conclusion upon a consideration of the evidence in the case that the presumption that arose by reason of the then reversioners giving consent to the transaction was rebutted by the facts transpiring in evidence.which she mortgaged all the properties that were allotted to haripada in his share as an additional security for the entire loan of rs.there is no doubt that both the

reversioners giving consent to the transaction was rebutted by the facts transpiring in evidence.ide enquiry by the mortgagee.it cannot bind the actual reversioner in any way.1.mr. chatterjee attempted to put forward an argument on the authority of certain observations in the case of bajrangi v. monokarnika( 2) that as the present appellants are the sons of ram narayan the admissions made by their father would bind them as well.the appellants who claim through matadin singh and baijnath singh must be held bound by the consent of their fathers.on the 5th of october, 1918.this contention of the appellant must therefore fail.1.as the sons of ram narayan claim as heirs of haripada and not of their father, the admissions, if any, made by the latter could not in any way bind them.in our opinion the contention formulated in this form really involves a misconception of the legal position of an alienee of a hindu widows property.if there is no legal necessity, the transferee gets only( 2) 35 i. a.the interest of a hindu widow in the pro-perties inherited by her bears no analogy or resemblance to what may be described as an equitable estate in english law and which cannot be followed in the hands of a bonafide purchaser for value without notice.on this point the, finding recorded by the high court is as follows in the present case, there is no scope for an argument that there was such representation of legal necessity or that on bona fide enquiry the alienee satisfied herself that there was such a necessity, for as i have already pointed out the security bond itself statesin this case the alienation was by way of mortgage.if an alienee from a hindu widow succeeds in establishing that there was legal necessity for transfer, he is completely protected and it is immaterial that the necessity was brought about by the mismanagement of the limited owner herself.from very early times the hindu widows estate has been described as qualified proprietorship with powers of alienation only when there is justifying necessity, and the restrictions on the powers of alienation are inseparable from her estate( 2).for legal necessity she can convey to another an absolute title to the property vested in her.in our opinion the view taken by the high court is quite proper.that it was in consideration of benefits already received and with a view to induce suhasini to forbear from proceeding against mohini, that the bond was being executed.whatever enquiries the appellants may have made( 1) 6 m. i. a, would be of no avail to them when the alienation is not binding on the whole estate but only on the womans estate of rashmoni.',\n"," '1951_40.txt': 'this is an appeal by special leave from this decision.the excess profits tax officer by his assessment order dated 11th

respondent for it had no other busi-ness that all the assets of the respondent including the dyeing plant were the assets of the business, that whatever income was derived by the use of these assets including the income that an asset fetched by its being let out was the business income of the assessee, and that there was no warrant in law forbut if the commercial asset has ceased to be a commercial asset in the hands of the assessee and thereafter he gets what he can out of it by letting it out to be used by others, then the rent he receives is not income from any business that he carries on.the time of being used as a commercial asset, then it is income from his business, whether he uses that commercial asset himself or lets it out to somebody else to be used.mr. justice tendolkar concurred in this view and ob-served as follows--the ratio of all these cases to my mind is that if there is a commercial asset which is capable of being worked by the assessee himself for the purpose of earning profits and the assessee instead of doing so, either voluntarily allows someone else to use it on payment of a certain sum or is compelled by law to allow it to be used in such manner, then what he receives is income from business.the learned counsel for the respondent urged that as soon as the assessee found difficulty in obtaining yarn the dyeing plant became redundant for its business and ceased to be an asset of its business and any income derived from the rent by letting out this asset was income received by the assessee from other sources and therefore was not charge-able to excess profits tax.we respectfully concur in the opinion of the learned chief justice that if the commercial asset is not capable of being used as such, then its being let out to others does not result in an income which is the income of the business, but we cannot accept the view that an asset which was acquired and used for the purpose of the business ceased to be a commercial asset of that business as soon as it was temporarily put out of use or let out to another person for use in his business or trade.suppose, for instance, in a manufac-turing concern the use of its plant and machinery can advan-tageously be made owing to paucity of raw materials only for six hours in a working day, and in order to get the best yieldmr. chatterjee for the respondent stressed the point that as the dyeing plant in the present case could not be made use of by the assessee in its manufacturing business owing to the non-availability of yarn, it ceased to be a commercial asset of the business of the assessee and became redundant to that business and that being so, any income earned by this asset which had ceased to be a commercial asset was not an income of the business but must be held to have been derived from a source other than business and fell within the ambit of section 12 of the indian income tax act, and on this income excess profits tax was not payable.he contended that the facts of this case were analogous to the case of inland revenue commissioners v. lies( 2) and it should be similarly decided.arising under the indian law and analogies and inferences drawn from those decisions are at times misleading.whatever the commercial asset produces is income of the business of which it is an asset, the process by which the asset makes the income being immaterial.the distinction becomes apparent from the following passage which occurs in atkinson j. s judgment in i less case( 2)--then it was suggested by counsel for the crown that the case was like the desoutter case( 3), where it was held that, if you make use of a patent in your business and also receive royalties from the use of the patent by others licensed to use it, those royalties

case is whether on the facts found, it could be said reasonably that the dyeing plant had become redundant for its business as a silk manu-facturing concern, simply by the circumstance that for the time being it could not be used by it personally for the purpose of dyeing silk yarn owing to the non-availability of yarn.instead of dyeing yarn, another person was allowed to dye jute( we are told),

the lease was to expire in february, 1938.1 to the appellants continuing in possession cannot be inferred, and we agree with this finding.both the courts below, after dealing with the matter elaborately, have concurrently held that in the circumstances of the case the consent of respondent no.in our judgment, the present case cannot be governed by that decision, because of the fact, which in our opinion is important that here the payment of rent up to the 31st march, 1938, was made not after the date of expiry of the lease, but on the 5th april, 1937, nearly a year before the expiry of the lease.been accepted after the expiry of the tenancy.there can be no question of the lessee continuing in possession until the lease has expired, and the context in which the provision for acceptance of rent finds a place clearly shows that what is contemplated is that the payment of rent and its acceptance should be made at such a time and in such a manner as to be equivalent to the landlord assenting to the lessee continuing in possession.this clause is evidently not applicable to the present case.it was contended on behalf of the appellants that the respondent no.the only other point which arises for consideration relates to the plaintiffs prayer for a decree for permanent injunction against the defendants, to restrain them from removing or otherwise disposing of the articles in regard to which the decree is to be passed.1 not being in possession of these properties could not ask for the relief of injunction without asking for the declaration of its title in respect of them and possession over them, and in support of this proposition, the following cases were cited-ratnasabhapathi pillai and others v. ramaswapart i and clause 1 of part iii of the lease,

raghuraj singh was the son of raja ajit singh by a continuously and exclusively kept concubine by name raj dulari, who had passed into the coneubinage of raja ajit singh after the death of her husband( 3) as the illegitimate son of raja ajit singh, ramraghuraj singh succeeded to a moiety of theappellants 1 and 2 are alleged to be the assignees pendente lite of the interest of the alleged reversioners.there are no exceptional circumstances in this case, at any rate none was brought to our notice, to compel us to depart from the usual practice.it is the usual practice of this court to accept the concurrent findings of the courts below.the 2nd appellant died and his legal representatives were not brought on record and the appeal so far as the 2nd appellant is concerned has abated.ramraghuraj singh was all along in joint possession of the estate with the widows, and, although the court of wards had assumed superintendence on behalf of the ranies, he was not out of possession during their lifetime and as such his title could not be extinguished by adverse possession( 6) the plaintiffs suit was barred under s. 26 of the central provinces court of wards act and( 7) the plaintiffs claim was barred by limitation.the answer to the question depends upon the content of the right of an illegitimate son to succeed to the self-acquired property of his putative father.the source of his right is found in the relevant hindu law texts.mitakshara in explanation of the texts of manu and yajnavalkya says in chapter 1, s. 12, in the following three verses thus the author next delivers a special rule concerning the partition of a sudras goods.the son, begotten by a sudra on a female slave, obtains a share by the fathers choice, or at his pleasure.even a son begotten by a sudra on a female slave may take a share by the fathers choice.him half as much as is the amount of one brothers allotment.we have already extracted the said verses.so in the second verse the words are that the brothers are to allow him to participate for half a share, and later on there is the same expression the son of the female slave participates for half a share only.but the language there is very distinct, that if the father be dead the bre-thren should make him partaker of the moiety of a share.the leading decision on the rights of an illegitimate son is that of the judicial committee in raja jogendra bhupati hurri chundun mahapatra v. nityanund mansingh( 1).sir richard couch cited two verses from mitakshara chapter 1, section 12.the judicial committee again considered the right of an illegitimate son in kamulammal v. visvanathaswami naicker( 2).ay high court and held that an illegitimate son and a legitimate son, being members of an undivided hindu family governed by mitakshara, the illegitimate son becomes entitled to the whole of the immoveable property of the family if the legitimate son dies without any male issue.sir lawrence jenkins observed at p. 37 thus here the contest is between the illegitimate son and the widow, and though the widow is not named in the text it is well settled that as a preferential heir to the daughters son she is included among those who share with the illegitimate son, and it would serve no useful purpose to speculate why she was not mentioned in the text.( 2)( 1922) l. r.but the language there is very distinct, that if the father be dead the bre-thren should make him partaker of the moiety of a share.so in the second verse the words are that the brothers are to allow him to participate for half a share, and later on there is the same expression the son of the female slave participates for half a share only.r. 55 mad.a continuous concubine has the status of a son, and that he is a member of the family that the share of inheritance given to him is not merely in lieu of maintenance, but in recognition of his status as a son it is not necessary to multiply decisions.during the lifetime of his father, the law allows the illegitimate son to take( 1)( 1931) i. l.member of the family to maintenance out of the joint family property in the hands of the collaterals with whom the father was joint.1. only such share as his father may give him.but his rights are limited compared to those of a son born in wedlock.we regret our inability to accept this proposition.for, if accepted, we would be speaking in two voices.once it is established that for the purpose of succession an illegitimate son of a sudra has the status of a son and that he is entitled to succeed to his putative fathers entire self-acquired property in the absence of a son, widow, daughter or daughters son and to a share along with them, we cannot see any escape from the consequential and logical position that he shall be entitled to succeed to the other half share when succession opens after the widows death.under the hindu law, the death of the widow opens inheritance to the reversioners and the nearest heir at the time to the last full owner becomes entitled to possession.856.55 mad.or daughters son and to a share along with them, we cannot see any escape from the consequential and logical position that he shall be entitled to succeed to the other half share when succession opens after the widows death.but a reference to that judgment shows that no such proposition has been laid down therein.to be supported by the author by reference to a decision of the madras high court in karuppayee ammal v. ramaswami( 1).the reason of the decision is therefore clear and that is when a daughters son succeeds to an estate, there is no further scope for the application of the doctrine of reverter.1938 nag.it is.assuming that learned counsel for the appellant was correct in his contention, we fail to see how

court was right in its conclusion.the learned judges of the high court were of the opinion that the word shareholder in s. 18( 5) had the same signification as the word member used in the indian companies act and that the assessee was not qualified to be considered as a shareholder, even though by a blank transfer it had, purchased the relevant shares.it was contended in the high court that inasmuch as s. 16( 2) referred to an i assessee, the assessee company was entitled to have the dividend grossed up by the addition of income-tax paid by the various companies at source and consequently to have the benefit of the credit allowed under the two remaining sections.it is itself chargeable under the act, in cull v. inland revenue commissioners( 1), lord atkin stated the law( which in substance is also the law in our country) thus my lords, it is now clearly established that in the case of a limited company the company itself is chargeable to tax on its profits, and that it pays tax in discharge of its own liability and not as agent for its shareholders at one time it was thought that the company, in paying tax, paid on behalf of the shareholder but this theory is now exploded by decisions in this house, and the position of the shareholders as to tax is as i have stated it.the position of a shareholder who gets dividend when his name stands in the register of members of the company causes no difficulty whatever.603, 636.though under( 1) 1940 a. c. 51, 56( 1939) 22 tax cas.the company recognises no person except one whose name is on the register of members, upon whom alone calls for unpaid capital can be made and to whom only the dividend declared by the company is legally payable.18( 5) and 49b( 1) to be payment by the shareholders.the share-holders, however, get the benefit of the payment of the tax by the company.buckley on the companies act, 12th edition, page 803 has pointed out that the right of a transferee is only to call upon the company to register his name and no more.-no rights arise till such registration, takes place.the learned lord justices held that under s.section 2( 16) of the indian companies act, 1913, defines share as share in the share capital of the company section 5 deals with the mode of forming incorporated companies, and in the case of companies limited by shares, the liability of the members is limited to the amounts, if any, unpaid on the shares respectively held by them.a glance at the scheme of the indian companies act, 1913, shows that the words member, shareholder and holder of a share have been used interchangeably in that act.the words holder of a share are really equal to the word shareholder and the expression holder of a share denotes, in so far as the company is concerned, only a person who, as a shareholder, has his name entered on the register of members.see nagabushanam v. ramachandra rao( 1).the transferee is entered in the register of members in respect thereof.the transferee can call upon the transferor to attend the meeting, vote according to his directions, sign documents in relation to the issuance of fresh capital, call for emergent meetings and inter alia, also compel the transferor to pay such dividend as he may have received.the words holder of a share are really equal to the word shareholder and the expression holder of a share denotes, in so far as the company is concerned, only a person who, as a shareholder, has his name entered on the register of members.( 1)( 1888) 37 ch.authorities on this point are not wanting, and indeed, in the judgment of the calcutta highthe assessee contends that the word shareholder includes even a person who holds a share as a result of a blank transfer, and does not necessarily mean a member of the company, whose name is on the register of members.the position, therefore, under the indian com-panies act, 1913, is quite clear that the expression shareholder or holder of a share in so far as that act is concerned, denotes no other person except a member.16( 2) and 18( 5) the assessee, who was a transferee on a blank transfer is entitled to the benefits of the grossing up of the dividend income.learned counsel for the assessee strenuously contends that the assessee being an owner in equity of the shares and thus also of the dividend is entitled to this benefit.117.( 5) 1940 1 ch.45 mad.court they have all been referred to.the assessee contends that the word shareholder includes even a person who holds a share as a result of a blank transfer, and does not necessarily mean a member of the company, whose name is on the register of members.they are all against the assessee.490.it is the common term used, and only means the person who holds the shares by having his name on the register.no valid reason exists why shareholder as used in s. 18( 5) should mean a person other than the one denoted by the same expression in the indian companies act, 1913.in in re wala wynaad indian gold mining company( 5), chitty, j., observed i use now myself the term which is common in the courts, i a shareholder, that means the holder of the shares.see shree shakti mills ltd. v.

rajasthan we have carefully perused the judgment and order passed by the high court.the high court has acquitted a 2 only on the ground that merely sitting on the chest of the deceased rules out the possibility of active participation by a 2 in the commission of offence and therefore has acquitted him from the charges under section 302 read with section 34 of the ipc.it therefore enacts that once it is found that a criminal act has been committed by several persons in furtherance of the common intention of all each of such persons is liable for the criminal act as if it were done by him alone.the nuances of section 34 of the ipc has been explained by this court in several decisions but we will only refer to the decision in the case of nadodi jayaraman and others vs. state of tamil nadu 1992 3 scc 161 and saravanan and another vs. state of pondicherry 2004 13 scc 238.section 34 of ipc enacts that when a criminal act is done by several persons in furtherance of the common intention of all each of such persons is liable for that act in the same manner as if it were done by him alone.therefore in order to bring home the charge of common intention the prosecution has to establish by evidence whether direct or circumstantial that there was plan or meeting of mind of all the accused persons to commit the offence before a person can be vicariously convicted for the act of the other.the facts in the present case in the light of the evidences on record are that a 1 and a 2 are brothers having an old enmity with the deceased resulting in a constant skirmish over the well located in their lands.as observed in hari ram vs. state of u. p 2004 8 scc 146 the existence of direct proof of common intention is seldom available and therefore such intention can only be inferred from the circumstances appearing from the proved facts of the case and the proved circumstances.on the said date of incident the animosity culminated to an assault on the deceased by the

of the learned attorney-general is pushed to tis logical conclusion, the form of the transcation is of its essence and its taxable or not according to the route the rice takes from the godown to the wedding feast.in our opinion, it would make no difference if the man instead of giving the feast himself hands over the rice to his daughter as a gift for the marriage festivities of her son.why should it make a difference if instead of keeping two sets of books he keeps only one?as he makes his purchases he enters his stock at the cost price on one side of the accounts.apart, however, from

present case, the assessees business received nothing in exchange for the withdrawl of the assets, neither money nor moneys worth, therefore the only fair way of treating the matter was to do just what the appellant did, namely to enter the price at which the assets were valued at the beginning of the year so that the entries would cancel each other out and level the business with neither a gain or a loss on those transcations.the learned attorney-general relied on gold coast selection trust limited v. humphrey( h. m. inspector of taxes)( 1949) 30 tax cas.we refrain from expressing any

not the market value of the asset as at the date of withdrawal?he withdraws from the in-trade of the business an asset which is of a depreciated value as compared with its value when it was brought

grossly inadequate and it is not the equivalent of the value of the property acquired, but this issue is not justiciable in view of the provisions of article 31( 4).the contention that there is no public purpose behind the impugned act has also to be repelled on the same reasoning as given by me in the bihar case.two further hurdles, viz., of articles 31-a and 31-b introduced by the amendments

revenue, to withdraw exemption of land revenue, wherever those had been granted, and to enact other laws of a similar character.lastly, it was urged that the legislation in question was not enacted bona fide inasmuch as in 1946 the legislature having passed a resolution to end zamindaries, proceeded to enact laws with the purpose of defeating the constitutional guarantees regarding payment of compensation by various devices.there is no evidence whatsoever that all these enactments were enacted with a fraudulent design of defeating the provisions of paymentit may be mentioned that under powers of compulsory acquisition a number of properties have been nationalized in england and other countries.significance is vital, not formal it is to be gathered not simply by taking the words and a dictionary, but by considering their origin and the line of their growth, and contended that if the constitution of india was constructed in the light of these observations, then despite the express provisions of article 31( 2) it would be found that there is something pervading it which makes the obligations to pay real compensation a necessary incident of the compulsory acquisition of property.the petition is therefore dismissed.the constitution had not even come into force by the time that most of these statutes were enacted.the guarantee has no greater scope than this.it was contended that by the terms of the covenant of merger those properties were declared as the petitioners private properties and were protected from state legislation by the guarantee given in article 362 of the constitution and hence the impugned act was bad as it contravened the provisions of this article.that guarantee has been fully respected by the impugned statue as it treats treats those properties is their private properties and seeks to acquire them on thatthe properties belonging to the petitioner and acquired under the statute were originally situate in an indian state which became subsequently merged with madhya pradesh.then other acts mentioned in the earlier part of the main judgment were enacted with the same end in view.it was within the competence of the government

reiterated mr. bindras contention that the legislation was not bona fide.487 of 1951.in my opinion, the argument is based on a fallacy.mr. mukherji who appeared in this petition merely adopted the arguments taken in other petitioners.petition no.jog appeared in this petition and raised the same points as in other petitions.there will be no order as to costs.as already stated, the purpose of the act is to bring about reforms in the land tenure system of the state by establishing direct contact between the tillers of the soil and the government.that status by occupancy tenants was possible under existing statutes and that they had also the power of transfer of their holdings.no appeal, however, appears to have been actually filed presumably because the present applications under under article 32 had already been filed in this court.the present bunch of petitions has been filed in this court under article 32 of the constitutional challenged the validity of the madhya pradesh act and praying for appropriate writs, directions and orders restraining the state of madhya pradesthe high court certified under article 132( 1) that the cases involved a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of the constitution.in the circumstances, the constituent assembly passed the constitution( first amendment) act, 1951, by section 4 and 5 of which two new articles, namely, article 31-a and article 31-b were inserted into the constitution.the legal validity of the constitution( first amendment) act, 1951, which was challenged, has however, been upheld by this court and all courts must give effect to the two new articles which are now substantive parts of our constitution.re.there is no dispute as to the correctness of the dates given to us by counsel for the petitioners.learned counsel appearing for the different petitioners accepted the position that as a result of the constitutional amendments the impugned act has been removed from the operation of the provisions of the part iii of the constitution and that consequently the attract on the act will have to be founded on some other provisions of the constitution.( a) in dealing with this ground of objection it will be helpful to note the course which the bill took before it was put on the statute book.learned counsel for other petitioners adopted and in some measure reinforced the arguments of mr. b. somayya.re.nobody put forward any reasoned amendment and the trend of the speeches shows that the house accepted the bill.then followed speeches by 11 speakers congratulating the government and some of the members who took an active part in carrying, through this important measure of land reform and relief to the tillers of the soil.( a) in dealing with this ground of objection it will be helpful to note the course which the bill took before it was put on the statute book.it was referred to a select committee on 15th october 1949.there is no evidence on affidavit by anybody who was present at the meeting of the assembly held on 5th april, 1950, as to be what actually happened on that date.the objection formulated by learned counsel for the petitioners is founded is founded on the rules of procedure framed by the assembly under section 84 of the government of india act, 1953 which were continued in force until new rules were farmed under article 208 of the constitution.the petitioners rely only on the absence in the official report of proceedings of any mention of the question being put to or carried by the assembly.it is urged that the question that the bill be passed into law was not to the assembly under rule 20 and if it was at all put the result of the voting, whether by voices or division, was never announced by the speaker as required by old rule 34.of the bill as it emerged through, the house was printed on 29th april, 1950, and speaker signed a copy of the printed bill on 5th may, 1950, and certified that it had been passed by the house and forwarded it to the governor.i am not prepared to accept this contention as sound.the petitioners rely only on the absence in the official report of proceedings of any mention of the question being put to or carried by the assembly.business the onus is undoubtedly on the petitioners to allege and prove that the procedure prescribed by the rules was not followed.there can be no doubt that the memory of the speaker was fresher on the 5th may, 1950, than it was on 1st october, 1950, when he singed a bunch of reports of proceedings.therefore, as a statement of a fact more reliance must be placed on the certification of the bill than on the confirmation of the proceedings and it will not be unreasonable to hold that the omission of any mention of the question having been put to and carried by the assembly was.the petitioners as i have said, strongly rely on the official report of the proceedings.( b) article 31( 3) on which this ground of attack is based runs as follows-no such law as is referred to in clause(( see mays parliamentary practice, 14th edn p. 544).an accidental slip or omission.in british parliamentary practice the speakers authentication is taken as conclusive( see cries on statute law, 4th ed., p. 36).there can be no doubt that the memory of the speaker was fresher on the 5th may, 1950, than it was on 1st october, 1950, when he singed a bunch of reports of proceedings.therefore, it is urged that after a bill is passed by the state assembly, the governor must assent to it so that the bill becomes a law and then that law, to have effect, must be reserved for the consideration of the president.that is not so.this admittedly, not having been done, the provisions of article 31( 3) cannot be said to have been complied with and, therefore, the act cannot have any effect at all.the argument is that article 31( 3) requires that a law must be reserved for the consideration of the president.it is said that this clause postulates a lawmade by the legislature of a state.the procedure to be followed after a bill is passed by the state assembly is laid down in article 200.reference is then made to article 168 which provides that for every state there shall be a legislature which shall consist of the governor and so far as madhya pradesh is concerned, of one house, i. e.re( g) the last ground of attack is that the 80 malaguzari mahals belonging to the petitioner in petition no., 1947, increasing the land revenue of the estates, revocations of exemptions act, 1948, revoking the exemptions from land revenue enjoyed by certain proprietors and finally the impugned act, has been relied on as evidence of a systematic scheme for expropriating the zamindars and it is contended that such a conduct clearly amounts to a fraud on the constitution.i see no improper delegation of legislative power at all.it is true that section 9 of the acts does not specially indicate when the instalments will began or what the amount of each instalments will be but the section clearly contemplates that these details should be worked out by rules to be framed under section 91 of the act.72 i.the occur to me several answers to this contention.a question was raised by mr. asthana appearing for the ruler of khairagarh who is the petitioner in petition no.in that covenant the properties in question were recognised as the personal properties of the ruler as distinct from the state properties.all that the covenant does is to recognise the title of the ruler as owner of certain properties.khairagarh is one of the states which formerly fell within the eastern states agency.the guarantee or assurance to which due regard is to be had is limited to personal rights, privileges and dignities of the ruler qua a ruler.mr. b. somayya has drawn our attention to the words without prejudice to the generality of the provisions of article 31-a occurring in the beginning of article 31-b and contended that the interpretation put upon these words by the judicial committee in shibnath banerjees case(( 1945) l. r.further this article does not import any legal obligation but is an assurance only.no circumstances be acquired by the state.the fact that his personal properties are sought to be acquired on payment of compensation clearly recognises his title just as the titles of other proprietors are recognised.',\n","

view.equalities, whichever view is taken.but such a construction would make the explanation useless.we have therefore to determine where the inter-state course ends and the intra-state course begins.( 2) 1906 a. c. 419.this case.equalities, whichever view is taken.there are bound to be some in.dealer in bombay, b, a dealer in madras, and c, a consumer also in madras.they obtain their wares from wholesale importers or large dealers in other states.that still gives a an advantage over b.in that event, b, the manufacturer in madras, pays no initiala very large volume of the feasibly taxable trade in this country, if not the bulk of it, at any rate in most states, is in the hands of retail dealers resident in the various states.that still gives a an advantage over b.ay, there is only one tax in the transaction on my lords view.but apart from this, the matter is, i think, largely theoretical save perhaps in a few exceptional cases.the price the ultimate consumer pays is the same wherever he purchases in a given area.but that did not prevent this court from holding in the state of travancore-cochin others v. the bombay co. ltd.( 1) that the sale which occasioned his import is free of tax.in this class of case, the trade usually adjusts its own differences by allowing the local dealer a discount in fact, in the case of many commodities, local dealers have to give an undertaking not to sell below a certain price in order to maintain a steady price level over the local market and avoid cut throat competition.most people prefer to pay the extra price and save themselves endlessif that is the normal way in which trade and commerce in that particular line of goods flows across the boundary, then that would, in my opinion, be a sale in the course ofthe taxing sections 5 and 10 empower a levy of tax on all sales made within the state of bombay when the turnover reaches a certain figure.1112, 1112 of bombay will not prevent it from being a sale effected in the course of inter-state trade or commerce or in the course of export or import.i will assume that delivery is made to b himself in bombay and that he carries the goods across in person.even when the whole transaction of sale is constituted in bombay in the sense that every essential ingredient necessary to constitute a sale takes place there,( that is to say, even when the explanation is not called into play), the sale would, given other considerations, be in the course of export or import or in the course of inter-state trade or commerce.the price the ultimate consumer pays is the same wherever he purchases in a given area.it was argued that the rules save the act in the following way.1113 the act came into force on 9th october, 1952, with the exception of the taxing sections.inter-state trade and commerce despite the facts, including delivery, mentioned above.so long as the ban imposed by clause( 2) remains the situs of the sale and the place of delivery are not material provided the sale is caught up in the vortex of inter-state trade and commerce.it embodies almost word for word every provision of the explanation to article 286( 1)( a).on this view, the preamble to the act and the short title which limit the ambit of the law to the levy of tax on sales and purchases of goods in the state of bombay, do not serve to save the act, nor do the definitions of the words sale, dealer and turnover.actually, explanation( 2) to the definition of sale directly offends clause( 2) of article 286.i can understand this court saving to a petitioner you are not yet hurt by this act nor is there any immediate likelihood of your being hurt and until.say the rules were to be amended tomorrow by striking out these saving clauses, which would be ultra vires, the act or the rules?rules save the act in the following way.it would be impossible to hold that the rules are ultra vires the act, for they would not in the event i am contemplating travel one whit beyond the act.i need not examine the rules for this purpose.it would, in my judgment, be no more competent for a rule-making authority to do that than it would have been competent for it to validate this act if the rules had been brought into 1114 being even one day after sections 5 and 10 came into force.and if the act is held to be ultra vires in an event like that, would it be competent to the rule-making authority to come to the rescue of the legislature and rehabilitate the act by re-enacting the rules which it had deleted a few days before?while agreeing in the main with the conclusions reached therein i am however unablei have now to consider two more points.i would therefore hold that the bombay sales tax act, 1952( bombay act no.bhagwati j.-i had the benefit of reading the judgment just delivered by my lord the chief justice.offending provisions can be struck out but if we do that the whole act goes because the defect here is that all sales are permitted to be taxed provided they are within the state of bombay, and the rulemaking authority is not restricted to taxation which is constitutionally permissible.on the question of severability, i cannot see how the good can be separated from the bad in this case even if the explanation to section 2( 14) be expunged unless the constitution be read as part of the act and we are to read into the act some such provision as follows notwithstanding anything which is said in any part of this act, all sales which the state is prohibited to tax under the constitution are excluded from the scope of this act.with all respect to the american judges who hold that view, i would prefer not to make exceptions.to subscribe to the reasoning as also the construction put upon the explanation to article 286( 1)( a).whereas before the constitution the taxing power could be exercised by reason of a sufficientmake exceptions.these were the three categories of sales or purchases which came within the ban imposed by article the phraseology used in the article laid particular stress on the fact that the sale or purchase should take place so as to fall within one or the other of these categories.that power has got to be widely construed and it would embrace the power to tax the sales or purchases of goods by reason of a sufficient territorial connection between the taxing state and what it seeks to tax.this was also the position which obtained before the constitution and was responsible for double or multiple taxation of the same transaction by different states.once the transfer of ownership or the passing of the property in the goods was accepted as the sole criterion of taxability it was not necessary at all to define what was a sale or purchase which took place 1117 inside the state.the intention was that the sale or purchase should take place, i. e., should be completed either outside the state or in the course of import or export or in the course of interstate trade or commerce.whether a sale or purchase took place inside the state could be determined by applying the general law relating to the sale of goods and ascertaining where the transfer of ownership took place or the property in the goods passed.they wanted to give the delivery state in that event the power to tax such sale or purchase and therefore introduced by the explanation to article 286( 1)( a) a legal fiction by which( 1) 1898 a. c. 200.( 2) 1906 a. c. 419.what otherwise would have been a sale or purchase which took place outside the state within the meaning of article 286( 1)( a) was thus by legal fiction deemed to have taken place inside the delivery state, thus assimilating the position to a sale or purchase which took place inside the delivery state enabling the delivery state to tax the sale or purchase in question. thisit would be surprising 1119 to find a definition of a transaction of sale or purchase which takes place inside the state given in the manner in which it is alleged to have been done in the explanation covering only those transactions of sale or purchase in which the goods have actually been delivered in the delivery state as a direct result of such sale or purchase for the purpose of consumption in that state.they do not comprise all the transactions of sale or purchase which take place inside the state because besides those there are a large number of transactions of sale or purchase which take place inside the state and in which no element of inter-state trade or commerce enters the transaction.what was a sale or purchase which took place outside the state was by reason of the explanation and the legal fiction enacted therein deemed to be a sale or purchase which took place inside the state so as to enable the delivery state to tax the sale or purchase in question.the transactions of sale or purchase which take place between dealers and dealers and dealers and customers all within the state are really comprised in the category of transactions of sale or purchase which take place inside the state and these transactions do not at all fall within the purview of the explanation.it would be a more natural way of reading the non-obstante clause to read into it an intention to state what according to the constitution makers was the basic idea of fixing the situs or the location of the sale or purchase in the place where the transfer of ownership took place or the property in the goods passed and to indicate that notwithstanding that fact a sale or purchase which fell within the category mentioned in the explanation was none, the, less to be deemed to have taken place inside the delivery state.obstante clause is to ignore the facts and do violence to the whole conception underlying the incorporation of the non-obstante clause in the explanation.the object and purpose of the explanation could only to be to deem such purchase or sale by reason of the legal fiction to have taken place in the delivery state so as to enable the delivery state also to tax the sale oror purchase will be deemed to have taken 1121 place inside the delivery state.the object of the explanation is not and could not be to take away the right which the state in which the property in the goods passed had to tax the sale or purchase which took place inside that state.in order to arrive at a conclusion whether the object and purpose of the explanation was to enable the delivery state to tax such sales or purchases either in addition to the state in which the property in the goods had passed or in substitution thereof one has got to bear in mind the basic idea that a state would normally be entitled to tax a sale or purchase where such sale or purchase took place inside the state except in cases covered by article 286( 1)( b) and article 286( 2).merely because a book is by a legal fiction deemed to be in the book case b it does not necessarily ceasethe explanation therefore covers only those cases where as-a direct result of the saledelivery of goods for the purpose of consumption in the delivery state therefore means the delivery for the purpose of using by the consumer and it has no application to the case of a dealer purchasing the 1124 goods across the border for dealing with or disposing of the same in the ordinary course of trade.a dealer who deals with the goods after purchasing the same does not consume the goods.he is not a consumer of those goods.it is only a transaction of sale or purchase directly results in the delivery of goods 1123 for the purpose of consumption in the delivery state that comes within the category of transactions covered by the explanation.it is not every transaction which results in the goods being delivered across the border that comes within this category.it is a well-known rule of the interpretation of statutes that a particular enactment is not repealed by a general enactment in the same statute.( beal on the cardinal rules of legal interpretation, 3rd edition, part vii, section ix, page 516).so far however as the delivery state is concerned the explanation empowers the delivery state to tax such transaction and if article 286( 2) be construed as imposing a ban on the taxation of such sale or purchase it will be tantamount to the giving of the right to tax by one hand and the taking away of it by another.so far as the state in which the property in the goods has passed is concerned it could certainly not tax the sale or purchase in question because the transaction of sale or purchase so far as the particular state is concerned takes place in the course of inter-state trade or commerce and could not be subjected to the imposition of tax except in so far as parliament might by law otherwise provide.do so to reconcile the provisions of the explanation to article 286( 1)( a) and article 286( 2).it is a well-known rule of the interpretation of statutes that a particular enactment is not repealed by a general enactment in the same statute.to the same effect also are the observations of quain j. in dryden v. overseers of putney( 2) quoted at page 426 of the same work-it may be laid down as a rule for the construction of statutes, that where a special provision and a general provision are inserted which cover the same subjectmatter, a case falling within the words of the special provision must be governed thereby and not by the terms of the general provision.churchill v. crease( 1).the two concepts are thus entirely different.this aspect was however not stressed or presented during the course of the arguments and i would prefer not to express any opinion on the scope or meaning of article 304.d. 232 at p 426, 1127 which are included in part xiii under the captiontrade, commerce and intercourse within the territory of india.i would therefore base my, construction of the explanation to article 286( 1)( a) and article 286( 2) on the rule as to the interpretation of statutes which i have referred to above, lifting the transaction of sale or purchase covered bycategory of transactions, in the course of inter-state trade or commerce covered by article 286( 2) and assimilated to transactions of sale or purchase which take place inside the state thus acquiring an intrastate character so far as the delivery state is concerned.in the result the declaration made by the court below will be seti agree that the bombay sales tax act, 1952, and the rules made, thereunder except rule 5( 2)( 1) do not contravene the provisions of article 286, that rule 5( 2)( 1) is clearly severable and can be ignored, that there is no substance in the contention of shri seervai that there is a violation of the fundamental rights guaranteed under article 14 and that the taxation statutes should be construed in a manner so as to allow the statute itself to stand, the taxing authority being prevented by injunction from imposing the tax on subjects excluded by the constitution from the purview of taxation by the state.held that both the states could tax or neither of them could tax such sale or purchase.the state in which the property in the goods passes would not be able to tax such sale or purchase in the absence of a provision enacted by law by parliament within the meaning of article 286( 2).',\n"," '2003_794.txt': 'same.therefore this decision in isha marbles cannot be taken advantage of by the

bombay at the date of the suit).a question of impartibility was raised but the bombay high court declared that the property in british india was partible.they further declared that bhujangrao i was the head of the family and as such was entitled to a special assignment which was not to exceed a quarter share, for the expenses and duties which might devolve on him by virtue of his position, and that after this had been set aside each of the three brothers was entitled to an equal one-third share in the landed property in india.h. c. r. 161.p-53 shows that the estate consisted of villages.the duties enumerated at page 170 included, the keeping up of armed retainers for the fort of gajendragad, and for the improvement of that village, which was the chief seat of this branch of the ghorpade family, and also to enable him to distribute on ceremonial occasions the customary presents to the junior members of the family.in compliance with this, the common ancestor shown at the head of the genealogical tree set out above was recognised by the british government as the saranjamdar of the gajendragad estate.it should however be clearly understood that the decision of the high court in not

emphasised by government in the same year on the 22nd august, 1882.the parties also had property in the state of kolhapur.malojirao who had already taken his share of the estate was to continue in

bhujangrao which the adopted son will now inherit.this position was emphasised by government in the same year on the 22nd august, 1882.it should however be clearly understood that the decision of the high court in not to be held as a precedent and that no partition of the jahagir estate to be continued to the adopted son will ever be allowed.the property should be dealt with like other saranjams in the political department.this prayer was refused and government stated it should be plainly under that government allow the adoption to be made only in consideration of bhujangrao one share as well as the portion assigned to him as head of the family being continued to the adopted son as indivisible jahagir estate descending in the line of male heirs in the order of primogeniture and subject to no terms whatsoever as to the enjoyment of the same by krishnabai during her lifetime.the portions applicable here were as follows-saranjams shall ordinarily be continued in accordance with the decision already passed by government in each case.after due consideration he thought that the interest of government and the saranjamdar would be sufficiently safeguarded by allowing the same position to continue.h. c. r. 161, malojirao alone separated and the other two brothers continued joint.were not affected.he ordered the entries to be made accordingly.the district deputy collector, after inspecting the records, found that the name of the khatedar saranjamdar alone has found place in the village inam register, in the saranjam list and the land alienation register.the litigation of 1901 put an end to that position.vi.ix.vii.ii.91 of the saranjam list.every saranjam shall be held as a life estate.having regard, however, to the manner in which different portions of the estate have been held by different branchesthe in-council agrees with the commissioner, southern division, that the assignments held by the bhaubands as potgi holders should be continued to them as at present.of the saranjam list.the defendants were evidently aggrieved by this, for they filed suit no.the collector should take steps to place the saranjamdar in possession of the villages of the saranjam estate which were in possession of the deceased saranjamdar.that in my opinion is an idle contention in view of paragraphs 9 and 12 of the plaint and reliefs( a) and( d).in any event, mr. somayya was asked whether he would strike out the third defendant and those portions of the plaint which sought relief against it.the first court dismissed the plaintiffs claim on the merits holding that government had the right to amend its resolution in the way it did.that it be declared that defendant 3( government) have no right to change the resolution no.sole saranjamdar in the revenue records and that the assignments held by defendants 1 and 2 are held by them as mere potgi holders.it is impossible to contend that this is not a claim relating to lands held as saranjam.it was next argued that if that be the case the claim against government can be dismissed and the plaintiff can at least be given the reliefs claimed against the other two defendants.in my opinion this is not a suit in which the rights claimed against the other defendants can be divorced from the claim against government and considered separately.that resolution directly relates to the land because it directs that the gajendragad saranjam he resumed and the collector is directed to take steps to place the saranjamdar in possession of the village of the saranjam estate etc.paragraphs 9 and 12 of the plaint and reliefs( a) and( d).( it is to be observed that a resumption under rule ix can only be of the land because the rule directs that when the saranjam is resumed government itself shall make provisions for the maintenance of those entitled to it out of the revenues of the saranjam so resumed.he said he was not prepared to do so.in any event, if the claim against government is to be ignored it can only be on the basis that its orders cannot be challenged and if the orders stand it is evident that the plaintiff can have no hope of success because both sides hold their respective properties on the basis of those orders.one of those rights, as we have been from rules vii and ix, is to take the revenues of the entire estate in order that he might fulfil his obligation regarding the payment of maintenance to certain members of the family and if the defendants claim to hold their lands under the orders of government and the plaintiff insists on retaining government as a party in order that it may be bound by the decree he wants against the other defendants it is obvious that his claim against these defendants cannot be separated from his claim against the government.claim relating to lands held as saranjam.these, it was contended, do not relate to land and in any event are not claims against the crown.it was next argued that if that be the case the claim against government can be dismissed and the plaintiff can at least be given the reliefs claimed against the other two defendants.plaintiff sued government and the second defendant and sought a declaration and injunction.in my opinion, this decision does not apply here.but, if they remain a party, it seems to me that there is a claim against them relating to property appertaining to the office of an hereditary officer, although no doubt it is quite true that the appellant does not desire to get any order against the government as to the way in which the property should be dealt with or anything of the sort, and he only wants a declaration as to his title which will bind government.103) that the courts have jurisdiction to decide whether government acted in excess of its powers and that that

the workers were entitled to under the earlier rules and it was argued that under the leave rules of the mills which prevailed prior to the coming into force of the factories act, the workers were entitled to privilege leave and there was no provision in those rules similar to the one that has been made in section 49-b or in the new rules and that the mills had no right to deprive them of leave

the tribunal has held that the lay-off could not be held to be altogether justified.in june, 1959, the bhilai steel works made their first shipment of pig iron addressed to, the appellant.in august, 1959, the said works despatched some wagons of pig iron to the appellant, but out of 20 wagons of the consignment, 14 were lost completely, and the rest misdelivered and were subsequently found somewhere in gomoh and some in tatanagar and they never reached the appellant in time.correspondence followed between the said companies and the appellant and finally in november, 1959, the appellant was informed by the said companies that they could not supply its requirements of raw material.in 1959, both the companies stopped supply of pig iron in spite of the order issued in that behalf by the controller, and they wrote to the appellant suggesting that the appellant should request the controller to cancel his order and place the same with some other suppliers.formerly, supply of pig iron used to come from the said two concerns to the appellant and the appellant used to pay cash to tata iron steel co. ltd. for the pig iron supplied by it and by a letter of credit to the indian iron steel co. ltd. on which the said company used to supply the raw material made by it.in august, there was a supply of 440 tons and in september, followed a supply of 36 wagons containing pig iron to

the decision of the bombay high court in commissioner of income-tax v. western india life assurance co., ltd., upheld this contention, and ruled that no part of the mysore profit could be taxed in british india.this is appeal from the judgment of the high court of judicature at bombay delivered on a reference under section 66( 1) of the indian income-tax act, 1922, whereby the high court answered the first referred question in the negative.it was contended that the assessee being a person resident in india, section 42 could not be invoked in the case, because that section had application only to cases of non-resident.the retention of this marginal note gave rise to conflicting decision on the question whether the section in spite of the chang made in its language in 1939 still continued to have application to cases of non-resident alone.in spite of its amendment in 1939 the marginal note to the section continued to refer to non-resident as before, though the words residing out of british india were deleted from the body of sub-section( 1).the rest of the section was substantially in the same termes.it is significant that the changes made in section 42 in the year 1939 were consequential to the entire recasting of section 4 of the act.by statutory fiction income which can in no sense be said to accrue at all may be considered as so accruing.no effect was

construction of the section would create an anomaly, inasmuch as the part b state income falling under section 42 would not be assessable in the hands of a resident, but it would be assessable in the hands of a non-resident, because the income-tax act, while it ropes in world income of a resident exempts income accruing within the part b states from its ambit, except when such income is received or is brought into taxable territory or comes within the ambit of section 42.in sutlej cotton mills ltd. v. commissioner of income-tax, west bengal, a bench of the calcutta high court considered this matter at some length and reached the decision the sub-sections( 1) and( 3) of section 42 covered cases of both residents as well as non-residents.again the matter was discussed in this court in commissioner of income-tax, bombay v. ahmedbhai umarbhai co., by patanjali sastri, j., as he then was, andwherever the legislature intended to limit the operation of any part of this section to non-residents alone, it said so in express terms.though reference was made in that case to the alteration in the structure of sub-section( i) its significance, as it seems to me, was not properly appreciated.the facts that the marginal note to the whole section refers to non-residents and that the section itself finds a place in chapter v headed liability in special cases were relied upon as supporting the view that sub-section( i) as a whole applies only to non-residents.before its amendment in 1939 the sub-section began with the words in the case of any person residing out of british india which obviously restricted the application of the provision to non-resident persons, but in its amended form the sub-section has been recast into two distinct parts, the first of which is not so restricted, and the second part alone, which begins with the words and where the person entitled to the income, profits and gains is not resident in british india, is made applicable to non-resident persons, thereby showing that the former part applies to both residents and non-residents.decision the sub-sections( 1) and( 3) of section 42 covered cases of both residents as well as

410 of 1960 and other companion appeals.before dealing with these contentions, it is necessary to mention very briefly the relevant facts which led to the confiscation of gold.at the enquiry the appellant appeared by counsel and examined four witnesses in support of his plea that he was in possession of gold which belonged to him and which wasthe appellant then applied for and obtained a certificate from the said high court and it is with the said certificate that he has come to this court for challenging the correctness of the order passed by the high court by which the confiscation of gold in question has been held to be valid.the said gold was then seized by the officer concerned acting on a reasonable belief that it was smuggled gold, and notice was issued against the appellant on may 20, 1957, calling upon him to show cause why action should not be taken against him for having contravened the notification issued by the government of india no.in our opinion, this argument is clearly misconceived.1000/-.basing himself on the finding of the high court that the appellant was not concerned in the importation of, smuggled gold, mr. bobde argues that even the goods cannot be confiscated under s. 167( 8).the union of india( 2) and it has been held that the language in item( 8) of s. 167 is clear and it permits the imposition of a penalty in excess of rs. 1000/-and that must be given effect to whatever may have been the intention in other provisions.we are not called upon to consider in the present appeal the correctness or propriety of this conclusion because there is no appeal by the respondent collector of central excise challenging this part of the high courts order.therefore, once s. 167( 8) is hold to be applicable, the validity of the order directing the confiscation of the smuggled goods is beyond any challenge.it would, thus be noticed that the combined effect of the aforesaid provisions of the two acts and the relevant notification is that the notification of 1948 has the force of a notification issued under s. 19 of the sea customs act, and in consequence, gold imported in contravention of the said notification is liable to be seized under.section 23-a provides that without prejudice to the provisions of s. 23 or to any other provision contained in the said act, the restrictions imposed by sub-s.( 1) and( 2) of s. 8 shall be deemed to have been imposed under s. 19 of the sea customs act, and all the provisions or that act shall have effect accordingly, except that s. 183 thereof shall have effect as if for the word shall therein the word, may was substituted.thus, bringing into india gold from outside is prohibited by this notification unless the said gold is brought with the general or special permission of the reserve bank.1) of the foreign exchange regulation act, 1947.that is the view taken by the high court when it rejected the appellants prayer for a writ quashing the order of confiscation passed by the collector of central excise in respect of the gold in question, and we see no reason to interfere with it.the next argument urged by mr. bobde is that certain witnesses whose evidence was recorded by the collector of central excise in the enquiry before him, were not produced for cross-examination by the appellant.at the enquiry, the appellant gave up thisin our opinion, there is no substance in this argument.then, as regards marotrao and rambhau, their statements were intended to show that the appellants case that he had got the gold melted through them was not true.in our opinion, this argument is not well-founded.examine him.their version on the point was no longer inconsistent with the subsequent case set up by the appellant.30, 000/-itself justified a reasonable belief in the mind of the officer that the gold may be smuggled.then, as regards marotrao and rambhau, their statements were intended to show that the appellants case that he had got the gold melted through them was not true.the first feature on which the officer relied is supplied by the quantity of gold in question.that being so, we do not think there is any substance in the argument that the seizure was effected without a reasonable belief and so is outside section 178a.after-all-, when we are dealing with a question as to whether the belief in the mind of the officer who effected the seizure was reasonable or not, we are not sitting in appeal over the decision of the said officer.30, 000/-itself justified a reasonable belief in the mind of the officer that the gold may be smuggled.the story subsequently mentioned by the appellant about his journey to tatanagar which has been disbelieved brings into bold belief the purpose which the appellant had in mind in travelling without a ticket.the

licensed dealers in hides or skins shall, subject to the provisions of section 3, be liable to taxation on each occasion of sale.this, therefore, is a clear provision which makes the single point imposition of sales tax on hides and skins to be conditional on observing the condition of taking a licence.the argument of inconsistency between r. 16( 5) of the turnover and assessment rules and s. 5( vi) of the act which was accepted in the high court receives no support from the language of that section which is a concessional provision for making the sales of hides and skins liable to taxation at a single point but that, as the opening words of the section show, is subject to restrictions and conditions prescribed in the rules and one of these conditions is the taking of a licence.the rule, which deals with licences is r. 5 of the sales tax rules, the relevant portion of which has already been set out it lays down that if a dealer desires to avail himself of the exemption provided in ss.if the restrictions and conditions contemplated by s. 5 read with the rules are not complied with, certain consequences follow as a result of s. 6-a of the act which

to be levied under s. 3 as if the provisions of s. 5 did not apply to such sales.certain specified goods set out in s. 5 of the act an exception is made.this, it appears, was not disputed by the

special leave to workmen attending proceedings of necessity, must therefore be set aside.220. hold that no such allowances are payable and no such order garanting leave may be made.the award made by him provided for retaining allowance to skilled and semiskilled workmen but none to unskilled workmen.that question is whether retaining allowance should be paid to unskilled workers in these

proceedings of necessity, if the question was res integra we are bound by the authority of punjab national banks case( 1) to( 1) 1957 s. c. r.when the matter comes before the tribunals for adjudication they have to decide the matter on the materials before them and it is not possible to derive much assistance from these reports of the committees.the real difficulty in coming to a conclusion lies in the fact that while there is no doubt on the one hand of the plight of the seasonal workmen during the off season, if they during such period remain prartically unemployed, there is some force also in the argument that it is neither just nor fair to treat these unfortunate people as the special responsibility of the particular industry or the factory where they are seasonally employed.while these considerations on either side are common to claims for retaining allowance for all seasonal workmen in all industries, the special facts and circumstances of the categories of workmen and different local circumstances in different industries play an important part in deciding the question.thus skilled and semi-skilled workers have often been able to put forward a strong case by pointing out that the specialized skill acquired by them makes it difficult for them to obtain suitable alternative employment in the off season.as regards the observations of the tribunal that seasonal employees are entitled to the benefit of provident fund, gratuity and also bonus which shows that in fact their connection with the employers is not broken the materials on the record are too scanty for arriving at any definite conclusion.it appears to be clear that once the season is over the unskilled workmen cease to have any contractual relations with the employers and may rejoin on the com-mencement of the season or may not rejoin at their sweet will.as regards the existence of opportunities of alternative employment for these unskilled workmen.the appellate tribunal has said that the grant of seasonal allowance to unskilled labour in the industry will promote stability, good relations and efficiency.', '1963_37.txt': 'february 15.the judgment of the court was delivered by gajendragadkar j.--mr.the labour court which tried the dispute came to the conclusion that the appellant had failed to justify the discharge of mr. banerjee and so, it has directed the appellant to reinstate him and pay him full emoluments from the date of his discharge up to the date of his reinstatement.on december 5, 1959, his services were terminated and he was informed that the appellant had lost confidence in him, and so, it bad decided to discharge him.accordingly, in lieu of notice, he was paid a months salary and was told that he ceased to be the employee of the appe-llant as from the date next after he received the order from the appellant.r. k. banerjee had been employed by the appellant, the tata oil mills co. ltd. as a salesman on april 3, 1956, as a probationer and he was confirmed on november 5, 1956.since the dispute could not be settled amicably, the union succeeded in persuading the government of west bengal to refer the dispute for adjudication to the second labour court on the ground that the said discharge was not justified.that, in brief, is thethe material facts leading to the termination of mr. banerjees services lie within a very narrow compass.the head ice accepted this report and on december 5, 1959, issued to mr, banerjee the order terminating his services.the head ice then instructed the calcutta sales ice by telephone to send for mr. banerjee and call for his explanation.the appellant has a sales ice in calcutta and the manager of the said ice visits the areas within his jurisdiction to inspect the work of salesmen.thereupon, mr. gupta made a report to the zonal manager on november 2, 1959, adversely commenting on mr. banerjees work.basing themselves on the plea that the discharge amounted to dismissal, the respondents pleaded that the failure of the appellant to hold an enquiry against mr. banerjee introduced a serious infirmity in the order passed against him and they argued that the conduct of the appellant was malafide and the dismissal of mr. banerjee amounted to victimisation.the head ice accepted this report and on december 5, 1959, issued to mr, banerjee the order terminating his services.for mr. banerjee and call for his explanation.accordingly, mr. banerjee was sent for and his explanation taken mr. gupta then made another report expressing his dissatisfaction with the explanation given by mr. banerjee.the labour court has found that according to the terms of contract under which mr. banerjee was employed by the appellant, the appellant was entitled to discharge mr. banerjee from its employment under rule 40( 1) of the service rules but it held that merely because the order served on mr. banerjee purported to be an order of discharge, that would not exclude the jurisdiction of the labour court to examine the substance of the matter.in coming to this conclusion, the labour court has given some reasons which are clearly unsupportable.even so, it proceeded to examine the propriety of the said action and came to the conclusion that mr. banerjees discharge from employment did not appear to it to be justified.this is clearly wrong because the two reports made by mr. gupta in respect of mr. banerjees conduct do amount to documentary evidence which cannot be lightly brushed aside.it has observed, for instance, that the appellant has not produced any documentary evidence in support of its allegation against the efficiency of mr. banerjee.it has then commented on the fact that the allegations made by mr. gupta against mr. banerjee on six counts are of a general character.this position was recognised by the labour appellate tribunal as early as 1951 in buckingham and carnatic co. ltd., v. workers of the company,( 1), and since then, it has been consistently followed vide chartered bank, bombay, v. chartered bank employees union( 2), and u.similarly, the labour court has accepted the fact that mr. gupta that called for and received mr. banerjees explanation and to that extent it has rejected mr. banerjee suggestion that he had not given any explanation a all but even so, the labour court has not considered the effect of this conclusion on the main controversy between the parties.mr. gupta took the view that mr. banerjee was very slow in his work as a salesman, that he was not able to judge the capacity of the dealers and to give them sufficient stocks in time, that he took no steps to put the products of the appellant on prominent view in the dealers shops, that he wag not looking after the past374. to the zonal ice, the labour court has observed that on this point there is the evidence of mr. banerjee against that of mr. gupta and there was no particular reason to believe one in preference to the other.in our opinion, therefore, the-reasons given by the labour court in support of its conclusion that the discharge of mr. banerjee was not justified are wholly unsatisfactory and so, it has become necessary for us to examine the evidence ourselves.these defects are specific and it is idle to refuse to give importance to this evidence merely on the ground that no specific instances had been cited.banerjees work and there is no reason, whatever, why the labour court should have been reluctant to accept this report.gupta expressly states six grounds on which mr. banerjees work was found to be unsatisfactory.when he was asked how that could be done, he agreed that the metal straps had to be removed for opening of the boxes, but he added that he had arranged to have them restrapped and nailed.ing of the posters, in fact in one place the poster was pasted upside down, that he was not educating the stockists and dealers as he could have done and that he was reluctant to put hard and intelligent work.it is remarkable that when mr. banerjee was asked about this report in cross-examination, he frankly stated that mr. gupta was not unfriendly towards him and he was really unable to say why mr. gupta should have made these adverse comments against his work.think that the answers given by mr. gupta in respect of these letters can be of any assistance to the respondents in discrediting mr. guptas evidence in any manner.on the whole, we have no hesitation in holding that the appellant acted bonafide in discharging mr. banerjees services when it accepted mr. guptas report and concurred with his conclusions that the explanation given by mr. banerjee was not satisfactory.', '2013_30.txt': 'the gold chain was stolen but no complaint was lodged at the

that in view of section 3( 8) of the general clauses act, a contract with the chief commissioner in a part c state is a contract with the central government, and that would be a disqualification for

not a disqualification for election even to the state legislature, as it is in parts a and b states.the second point that was argued before us in appeal was that the respondent had appointed certain government servants to act as polling agents, and had thereby committed a major corrupt practice under section 123( 8) of act no.this conclusion, however, can result in no advantage to the petitioner,

thatrule 27 provides that when there is a doubt as to the identity of a voter, the presiding officer may interrogate the voter and that be should do so, if so required by a polling agent.the duties of a polling agent as laid down by the rules and furtfier elucidated by the instructions contained in the election manual issued by the government, the polling agent must be held to be interested in the candidate for whom he acts as polling agent, and that his employment would therefore be hit by section 123( 8).the first category relates to the period of time antecedent to the recording of votes.indeed, the work of the polling agent both in the first stage and in the last stage is similar in character, and neither can be said to contravene section 123( 8).what that passage means is that as the duty to be performed by the polling agents at the, the presiding officer may employ at the polling station such persons as he thinks fit to assist him-or any polling officer in identifying the electors.the third stage is reached after the polling is over.it cannot be said that in carrying out these duties the polling agent advances the election prospects of the candidate, as they admittedly relate to a stage after the completion of the polling.accordingly, we reaffirm the view taken by us that the appointment of a government servant as polling agent does not, without more, contravene

proceedings resulting in undesirable congestion in the files of the executing court by keeping alive so many execution proceedings.thus the adjournment of the execution pro-ceedings kept the attachment alive without any special direction.great stress was laid by the learned advocate for the appellants on the words struck off for the present occurring in the body of that petition.it is quite obvious that the court made an order of the third kind mentioned above.the three forms of order permissible under rule 57 as amended by the highit will be noticed that those words formed part of

of all these matters i have not the least doubt in my mind that the order of january 30, 1937, was in form and in substance a final order of dismissal of the execution case no.the fact that the order was entered in that column affords some justification for the conclusion that the court made a final order of dismissal.there is no substance in this argument.learned advocate for the appellants contended that if the execution case came to an end the attachment could not be left hanging in the air.calcutta high court in rule 57.it rests upon the solid foundation of a special order which rule 57, as amended, in terms authorises the court to make.understood that the order that it made on january 30 1937, was a final order of dismissal and that the attachment had been continued by a special order.that is what was done in this case.in my judgment, the order of january 30, 1937, was a final order which brought the execution case no.as to( ii)--learned advocate for the appellants then contended that the petition( ex.i do not think this argument is sound.suit no.2a) was not an application such as would initiate a proceeding in execution for any of the purposes mentioned in clauses( a) or( b) or( c) of section 2( 22) of the act.the order made on that petition also shows that the decree was recorded as adjusted and the attachment was cancelled.2a) dated june 2, 1939, amounted to a proceeding in execution and as that was insti-tuted and was pending after january 1, 1939 the proceedings came within the definition in section 2( 22) of a suit to which this act applies.holder there is, nevertheless, an execution proceed-ing pending merely because the attachment continues.such attachment cannot be called a proceeding in execution, for none was ever initiated after the decree was passed.their lordships cannot agree with this suggestion.( with which waight j. agreed), and in the argument for the re-spondents that if a sub-mortgagee were an assignee within section 36, sub-section( 5), of the act., certain difficul-ties and anomalies would result.500.the learned( 1) 20 ch.they express no view as to the position which arises if the sub-mortgage contains only a charge

section 36.72 i. a.300, the balance of the reduced debt after paying the sub-mortgagee in full.the decision referred to above is, therefore, directly in point and rules the present case.400.as to contention( b), it is impossible to read subsec-tion( 5) of section 36 as referring only to an assignee( 1) 50 c. w. n.( 2) l. r.83-84).74. of a mortgage decree.it was suggested that the said decision was inconsist-ent with the earlier decisions of the same tribunal in ram kinkar banerjee v. satya charan srimani( 1) and jagadamba loan co. v. raja shiba prasad singh( 2).this is a rather super-ficial view of the matter.this proposition, it was said, implied that in a sub-mortgage all the rights of the original mortgagee are not assigned to the sub-mortgagee and that the mortgagee still retains a legal( 1) 64 i. a.case.it was suggested that the said decision was inconsist-ent with the earlier decisions of the same tribunal in ram kinkar banerjee v. satya charan srimani( 1) and jagadamba loan co. v. raja shiba prasad singh( 2).earlier decisions they held that in india a legal interest remained in the mortgagor even when the mortgage was in the form of an english mortgage, and that the interest taken by the mortgagee was not an absolute interest.the act affords relief to certain classes of debtors by curtailing pro tanto the rights of the creditors, subject to certain exceptions in regard to assignments of loans.to bring the case within the purview of the act.present case, as to whether a mortga-gee becomes an assignee of the mortgage debt and of the mortgagees right to recover

the bettiah raj was informed about the benami nature of the transaction and rai bahadur motilal basu, the assistant manager of the bettiah raj, which was under the court of wards, was informed about this.in our opinion, the application of the maxim was erroneous.it is also clear that in 1936 when the dispute went to the district magistrate, champar an, all these facts were set out in the rival

it therefore appears that the fraud was not effected, because the person or authority said to be defrauded knew all the facts, and elected not to take any action.it is upon that ground the court goes not for the sake of the defendant, but because they will not lend their aid to such a plaintiff.the question is whether this illegality is sufficient to non-suit the plaintiffs on the application of the maxim.in salmond and william on contracts, four such exceptions have been mentioned, and the fourth of these exceptions is based on the right of restitutio in integrumforms, which were also signed with the names of these persons.if, from the plaintiffs own stating or otherwise, the cause of action appears to arise ex turpi causa, or the transgression of a positive law of this country, there the court says he has no right to be assisted.all these facts were capable of being investigated, including the making of the signatures by radhumal.to prove these things, it did not require the proof of

that caseit does not take away the central governments authority to refer an industrial dispute in respect of bonus for adjudication under s. 10 of the industrial disputes act.if the central government decides that no bonus should be paid, no bonus can be paid by the insurer.the legislature thought that the payment of bonus by the insurance companies to their employees should normally be prohibited and its payment should be permitted subject to the over-riding control of the central government to prescribe the maximum in that behalf.that is why the appellants contend that the enabling provision contained in proviso( vii) should not be construed to constitute a bar against the central governments power to act under s. 10( 1) of the industrial disputes act.a similar question has been

possession only until payment of the mortgage money, and.the right conferred by this section is called a right to redeem and a suit to enforce it is called a suit for redemption.a security cannot exist after the loan had been paid up.the case does not deal with the circumstances in which the mortgage ceases to exist.this was only an agreement to convey the lands after three months, and, if at

that would not be to enforce his right of redemption which was really his right to make those demands on payment of the mortgage money.the right to demand the mortgagee to do certain things on payment of the mortgage money is different from enforcing the demands subsequent to the payment of the money.rule 9 provides that if on such accounting, any sum be found due to the mortgagor, the decree would direct the mortgagee to pay such amount to the mortgagor..1946.1950 nag.section 62, on the other hand, is in marked contract to s. 60.618, 621.the framers of the transfer of property act have clearly

petition before the election tribunal for trial.was not fatal to the petition in view of the provisions of order 1, rule 9, civil procedure code.in any event the non-joinder of a party.on the 26th august, 1952, which was the first date of hearing before the tribunal, the appellant raised a preliminary objection that the omission to implead baijnath, a duly nominated candidate as a respondent in the petition.-was fatal to its maintainability.none of these propositions however have any application if the special law itself confers authority on a tribunal to proceed with a petition in accordance with certain procedure and when it does not state the consequences of non-compliance with certain procedural requirements laid down by it.lastly, it was contended that the provisions of the code of civil procedure were applicable to the trial of petitions but could not be of assistance in determining whether a petition had been validly presented.if the terms and conditions precedent prescribed by the statute were not complied with, it had no jurisdiction to act.part vi of the act deals with disputes regarding elections.section 81 provides that an election petition calling in question any election may be presented on one or more of the grounds specified in sub-sections( 1) and( 2) of sections 100 and 101 to the election commission by any candidate at such election or any-elector in such form and within such time but not earlier than the date of publication of the name or names of the returned candidate or candidates at such election under section 67, as may be prescribed that an election petition shall be deemed to have been presented to the election commission( a) when it is delivered to the secretary to the commission or to such other officer as may be appointed by the election commission in this behalf-by the person making the petition, or by a person authorized in writing in this behalf by the person making the petition or( b) when it is sent by registered post and is delivered to the secretary to the commission or the officer so appointed.it is in these circumstances necessary to set out the different provisions of the act relevant to the matter canvassed before us.have any application if the special law itself confers authority on a tribunal to proceed with a petition in accordance with certain procedure and when it does not state the consequences of non-compliance with certain procedural requirements laid down by it.such a petition can only be dismissed at the conclusion of the trial and on grounds sufficient to dismiss it( section 98secretary to the commission or the officer so appointed.provision, is then made for constituting the tribunal and the place where the trial should take place.section 84 concerns the relief which a petitioner may claim, and section 85 provides that if the provisions of sections 81, 83 or 117 are not complied with, the election commission shall dismiss the petition.section 90 prescribes the procedure to be followed by the tribunal.section 82 provides as follows a petitioner shall join as respondents to his petition all the candidates who were duly nominated at the election other than himself if he was so nominated.).provisions of sections 110, 115 and 116 of chapter iv of this part also support this view.this provision indicates that the array of parties as provided by section 82 is not final and conclusive and that defects can be cured.properly verified and the allegations contained therein stated with a certain amount of definiteness and accuracy and it is an express provision of part vi itself that the procedure of the tribunal is to be governed by the code of civil procedure and where a petition complies with sections 81, 83 or 117, the commission is bound to refer the petition to an election tribunal and the tribunal, unless it is of the opinion that the petition is not in accordance with sections 81, 83 or 117, is bound to try it and decide it according to the provisions of law.in that case two persons who had beenin our opinion, the tribunal rightly disallowed the preliminary objection.it is unnecessary to discuss all these decisions in detail.mr.

held that non-compliance with the provisions of section 82 is not fatal to the petition.it will be sufficient to say.the tribunal held that the defect was not fatal.the member of the tribunal who dissented from the majority view gave cogent and sound reasons for holding that non-joinder of a duly nominated candidate who has withdrawn was not necessarily fatal to the petition.in another case, petition no.was accompanied by all the necessary lists required by section 83( 2).these observations run counter to the scheme of the act itself as envisaged by section 85.113 of 1952, decided on 28th july, 1953, the majority of the bombay tribunal, decided otherwise.various provisions of the act referred to above show that the election petition does not necessarily abate or fail by reason of the death of the petitioner or any of the respondents or by their ceasing to take any interest in the trial of the petition once that petition has been referred to the tribunal.in our opinion the determination of the question whether the parties to the petition have been properly impleaded is a matter not for the election commission but for the tribunal.the, tribunal is given a similar power

together evidenced a transfer of title from the mortgagors to the mortgagees and, therefore, operated to extinguish the equity of redemption not only of shiddappa but also of annappa, for there is sufficient evidence on record that shiddappa was the manager and karta of the joint family and that in the matter of passing the rajinama he had acted in that capacity and, therefore, the rajinama was binding on his brother annappa.we are unable to accept this argument as correct.it is true that the principal one of such persons must enter into a written agreement to become the registered occupant.an absolute relinquishment shall be deemed to to have effect from the close of the current year, and notice thereof must be given before the 31st march in such year, or before such other date

occupancy and amounted to a relinquishment of the rights of both the brothers shiddappa and annappa.we are unable to accept this argument as correct.the concluding paragraph of the section clearly recognises that a relinquishment may be in favour of more persons than one.that does not mean, in the absence of any specific pleading and cogent proof, that a notice of relinquishment given by the registered occupant must necessarily be a notice on behalf of all occupants or any particular occupant other than the registered occupant, or that the registered occupant has the right to give such a notice without reference to the other occupants so as to effect their interest in the occupancy.that their right as occupants remains is clearly recognised by the opening paragraph of the section which gives an occupant a right to relinquish his occupancy either absolutely or in favour of a specified person.it was held that though the conveying brother was a co-mortgagor with the plaintiffs, he had no right to sell their interest in the equity of redemption and that, so far as they, were concerned, he was in the same position as an outsider.', '1954_13.txt': 'accordingly their petitions

compromise, in substance, were, that the properties in suit were to be held in divided shares between the three parties and specific allotments were made in favour of each, the properties allotted to the share of haripada being specified in schedules gha and chha attached to the compromise petition.this order however was modified by a subsequent order made on 23rd june, 19 10, which directed that

presumption of legal necessity, was that presumption rebutted in the present case by the evidence adduced by the parties?mr. chatterjee lays stress on the fact that it was a matter of imperative necessity for both the plaintiffs to get back the estate of their father from the hands of the receiver as the debts contracted by the receiver were mounting up day after day.the contentions, though somewhat plausible at first sight, seem to us to be wholly without substance.it has been found on facts that rashmoni had no occasion to incur any debts either for litigation expenses or for any other purpose.not a mere moral obligation but a legal liability on the part of the lady, as mohini could have claimed contribution from her to the extent that haripadas estate was benefited by the deposit.this might furnish some excuse or explanation for mohinis borrowing money on the 28th january, 191 1, but that could not make the act of rashmoni in executing the security bond, seven months after that event, an act of prudent management on her part dictated either by legal necessity or considerations of benefit to the estate of her deceased son in the first place it is to be noted-that the total amount borrowed by mohini was rs.as was found, on investigation of accounts, under orders of the high court later on, nothing at all was due to the receiver by the estate of haripada or

fact no necessity for raising money for that purpose at all existed at that time.been already accomplished by mohini who borrowed money on his own responsibility.the utmost that could be said was that rashmoni was bound to reimburse mohini to the extent that the deposit of money by mohini had benefited the estate of haripada.undoubtedly the accounts were still to be investigated but what necessity there possibly could be for rashmoni to execute, after the high court had made the order as stated above, a security bond by which she mortgaged all the properties that were allotted to haripada in his share as an additional security for the entire loan of rs.the high court dispos-ed of the revision case on 29th may, 1611, and directed investigation into the accounts of the receiver by a commissioner appointed by it.mr. chatterjee placed considerable reliance upon another document which purports to be a deed of declaration and was executed by ram narayanthe second point urged by mr. chatterjee raises the question as to whether the fact of mohinis joining his mother in executing the security bond would make the transaction binding on the actual reversioner, mohini being admittedly the presumptive reversioner of haripada at the date of the transaction.the alienation here, was by way of mortgage and so no question of surrender could possibly arise.in our opinion the view taken by the courts below is quite proper and as a concurrent finding of fact it should not be disturbed by this court.there is no doubt that both the courts below have proceeded on a correct view of law and both have come to the conclusion upon a consideration of the evidence in the case that the presumption that arose by reason of the then reversioners giving consent to the transaction was rebutted by the facts transpiring in evidence.which she mortgaged all the properties that were allotted to haripada in his share as an additional security for the entire loan of rs.there is no doubt that both the courts below have proceeded on a correct view of law and both have come to the conclusion upon a consideration of the evidence in the case that the presumption that arose by reason of the then reversioners giving consent to the transaction was rebutted by the facts transpiring in evidence.ide enquiry by the mortgagee.it cannot bind the actual reversioner in any way.1.mr. chatterjee attempted to put forward an argument on the authority of certain observations in the case of bajrangi v. monokarnika( 2) that as the present appellants are the sons of ram narayan the admissions made by their father would bind them as well.the appellants who claim through matadin singh and baijnath singh must be held bound by the consent of their fathers.on the 5th of october, 1918.this contention of the appellant must therefore fail.1.as the sons of ram narayan claim as heirs of haripada and not of their father, the admissions, if any, made by the latter could not in any way bind them.in our opinion the contention formulated in this form really involves a misconception of the legal position of an alienee of a hindu widows property.if there is no legal necessity, the transferee gets only( 2) 35 i. a.the interest of a hindu widow in the pro-perties inherited by her bears no analogy or resemblance to what may be described as an equitable estate in english law and which cannot be followed in the hands of a bonafide purchaser for value without notice.on this point the, finding recorded by the high court is as follows in the present case, there is no scope for an argument that there was such representation of legal necessity or that on bona fide enquiry the alienee satisfied herself that there was such a necessity, for as i have already pointed out the security bond itself statesin this case the alienation was by way of mortgage.if an alienee from a hindu widow succeeds in establishing that there was legal necessity for transfer, he is completely protected and it is immaterial that the necessity was brought about by the mismanagement of the limited owner herself.from very early times the hindu widows estate has been described as qualified proprietorship with powers of alienation only when there is justifying necessity, and the restrictions on the powers of alienation are inseparable from her estate( 2).for legal necessity she can convey to another an absolute title to the property vested in her.in our opinion the view taken by the high court is quite proper.that it was in consideration of benefits already received and with a view to induce suhasini to forbear from proceeding against mohini, that the bond was being executed.whatever enquiries the appellants may have made( 1) 6 m. i. a, would be of no avail to them when the alienation is not binding on the whole estate but only on the womans estate of rashmoni.', '1951_40.txt': 'this is an appeal by special leave from this decision.the excess profits tax officer by his assessment order dated 11th june,

respondent for it had no other busi-ness that all the assets of the respondent including the dyeing plant were the assets of the business, that whatever income was derived by the use of these assets including the income that an asset fetched by its being let out was the business income of the assessee, and that there was no warrant in law forbut if the commercial asset has ceased to be a commercial asset in the hands of the assessee and thereafter he gets what he can out of it by letting it out to be used by others, then the rent he receives is not income from any business that he carries on.the time of being used as a commercial asset, then it is income from his business, whether he uses that commercial asset himself or lets it out to somebody else to be used.mr. justice tendolkar concurred in this view and ob-served as follows--the ratio of all these cases to my mind is that if there is a commercial asset which is capable of being worked by the assessee himself for the purpose of earning profits and the assessee instead of doing so, either voluntarily allows someone else to use it on payment of a certain sum or is compelled by law to allow it to be used in such manner, then what he receives is income from business.the learned counsel for the respondent urged that as soon as the assessee found difficulty in obtaining yarn the dyeing plant became redundant for its business and ceased to be an asset of its business and any income derived from the rent by letting out this asset was income received by the assessee from other sources and therefore was not charge-able to excess profits tax.we respectfully concur in the opinion of the learned chief justice that if the commercial asset is not capable of being used as such, then its being let out to others does not result in an income which is the income of the business, but we cannot accept the view that an asset which was acquired and used for the purpose of the business ceased to be a commercial asset of that business as soon as it was temporarily put out of use or let out to another person for use in his business or trade.suppose, for instance, in a manufac-turing concern the use of its plant and machinery can advan-tageously be made owing to paucity of raw materials only for six hours in a working day, and in order to get the best yieldmr. chatterjee for the respondent stressed the point that as the dyeing plant in the present case could not be made use of by the assessee in its manufacturing business owing to the non-availability of yarn, it ceased to be a commercial asset of the business of the assessee and became redundant to that business and that being so, any income earned by this asset which had ceased to be a commercial asset was not an income of the business but must be held to have been derived from a source other than business and fell within the ambit of section 12 of the indian income tax act, and on this income excess profits tax was not payable.he contended that the facts of this case were analogous to the case of inland revenue commissioners v. lies( 2) and it should be similarly decided.arising under the indian law and analogies and inferences drawn from those decisions are at times misleading.whatever the commercial asset produces is income of the business of which it is an asset, the process by which the asset makes the income

process of manufacture.609. and a patent, and he did not think the desoutter case( 1) threw any light on the matter a patent is quite different from freehold land.the short question to decide in this case is whether on the facts found, it could be said reasonably that the dyeing plant had become redundant for its business as a silk manu-facturing concern, simply by the circumstance that for the time being it could not be used by it personally for the purpose of dyeing silk yarn owing to the non-availability of yarn.instead of dyeing yarn, another person was allowed to dye jute( we are told), the assessee company making income out of its use as a commercial asset.it is difficult to conceive that the company would not have immediately started dyeing yarn as soon as it became available.',

circumstances under which this question and several subsidiary questions to which reference will be made later have arisen may be briefly stated as follows the province of bengal,( hereinafter referred to as the respondent no.the case of the respondent no.1, who is the plaintiff in the present litigation, is that the appellant( defendant no.1, and hence the lease had not validly terminated, that nowhich were claimed to have become the property of the plaintiff.50, 000 all the boilers, engines, trucks, kilns, railway and tramway lines and all other movable property, plant and machinery on

within 3 months from the termination of the lease.16, 840 for damages caused to the field and( d) a decree for permanent injunction restraining the defendants from removing or otherwise disposing of

property.which were claimed to have become the property of the plaintiff.the prayer for damages for injury alleged to have been caused to the field and the prayer for injunction were however disallowed.1 was not entitled to the relief of injunction.4, 000 as mesne profits up to the date on which the respondent no.16, 840 for damages caused to the field and( d) a decree for permanent injunction restraining the defendants from removing or otherwise disposing of the bricks, pugmils, etc.the learned judges of the high court who heard the appeal, by their judgment dated the 13th february, 1948, dismissed the appellants appeal and allowed the cross-objection of the respondent no.from the site, on which date government will take over possession of the property from you.the correspondence to which reference has been made does not show that at any point of time the plaintiff had assented to the appellants continuance of possession.on the other hand, some of the letters written by the appellants show that, notwithstanding their having paid rent up to the 31st march, 1938, they had proceeded all along on the footing that the lease was to expire in february, 1938.on the 27th august, 1937, the appellants applied to the secretary to the government of bengal, public works department, for renewing the lease for a further period of 10 years, but no reply was received to that letter.1928.apart from the fact that the appellants didon the other hand, at the end of this letter, we find the following statement-we therefore pray that if the government is not at all inclined to renew the lease, time may be granted to us for dismantling and removing till the end of december, 1938, and we shall pay the proportional rent to the government for seven months time in pursuance of the terms of the lease.the letters written by the appellants show that, notwithstanding their having paid rent up to the 31st march, 1938, they had proceeded all along on the footing that the lease was to expire in february, 1938.1 to the appellants continuing in possession cannot be inferred, and we agree with this finding.both the courts below, after dealing with the matter elaborately, have concurrently held that in the circumstances of the case the consent of respondent no.in our judgment, the present case cannot be governed by that decision, because of the fact, which in our opinion is important that here the payment of rent up to the 31st march, 1938, was made not after the date of expiry of the lease, but on the 5th april, 1937, nearly a year before the expiry of the lease.been accepted after the expiry of the tenancy.there can be no question of the lessee continuing in possession until the lease has expired, and the context in which the provision for acceptance of rent finds a place clearly shows that what is contemplated is that the payment of rent and its acceptance should be made at such a time and in such a manner as to be equivalent to the landlord assenting to the lessee continuing in possession.this clause is evidently not applicable to the present case.it was contended on behalf of the appellants that the respondent no.the only other point which arises for consideration relates to the plaintiffs prayer for a decree for permanent injunction against the defendants, to restrain them from removing or otherwise disposing of the articles in regard to which the decree is to be passed.1 not being in possession of these properties could not ask for the relief of injunction without asking for the declaration of its title in respect of them and possession over them, and in support of this proposition, the following cases were cited-ratnasabhapathi pillai and others v. ramaswapart i and clause 1 of part iii of the lease, which have already been quoted.', '1961_417.txt': 'the trial court as well as the high court concurrently gave the following findings( 1) raja ajit singh belonged to the sudra caste( 2) raja raghuraj singh was the son of raja ajit singh by a continuously and exclusively kept concubine by name raj dulari, who had passed into the coneubinage of raja ajit singh after the death of her husband( 3) as the illegitimate son of raja ajit singh, ramraghuraj singh succeeded to a moiety of theappellants 1 and 2 are alleged to be the assignees pendente lite of the interest of the alleged reversioners.there are no exceptional circumstances in this case, at any rate none was brought to our notice, to compel us to depart from the usual practice.it is the usual practice of this court to accept the concurrent findings of the courts below.the 2nd appellant died and his legal representatives were not brought on record and the appeal so far as the 2nd appellant is concerned has abated.ramraghuraj singh was all along in joint possession of the estate with the widows, and, although the court of wards had assumed superintendence on behalf of the ranies, he was not out of possession during their lifetime and as such his title could not be extinguished by adverse possession( 6) the plaintiffs suit was barred under s. 26 of the central provinces court of wards act and( 7) the plaintiffs claim was barred by limitation.the answer to the question depends upon the content of the right of an illegitimate son to succeed to the self-acquired property of his putative father.the source of his right is found in the relevant hindu law texts.mitakshara in explanation of the texts of manu and yajnavalkya says in chapter 1, s. 12, in the following three verses thus the author next delivers a special rule concerning the partition of a sudras goods.the son, begotten by a sudra on a female slave, obtains a share by the fathers choice, or at his pleasure.even a son begotten by a sudra on a female slave may take a share by the fathers choice.him half as much as is the amount of one brothers allotment.we have already extracted the said verses.so in the second verse the words are that the brothers are to allow him to participate for half a share, and later on there is the same expression the son of the female slave participates for half a share only.but the language there is very distinct, that if the father be dead the bre-thren should make him partaker of the moiety of a share.the leading decision on the rights of an illegitimate son is that of the judicial committee in raja jogendra bhupati hurri chundun mahapatra v. nityanund mansingh( 1).sir richard couch cited two verses from mitakshara chapter 1, section 12.the judicial committee again considered the right of an illegitimate son in kamulammal v. visvanathaswami naicker( 2).ay high court and held that an illegitimate son and a legitimate son, being members of an undivided hindu family governed by mitakshara, the illegitimate son becomes entitled to the whole of the immoveable property of the family if the legitimate son dies without any male issue.sir lawrence jenkins observed at p. 37 thus here the contest is between the illegitimate son and the widow, and though the widow is not named in the text it is well settled that as a preferential heir to the daughters son she is included among those who share with the illegitimate son, and it would serve no useful purpose to speculate why she was not mentioned in the text.( 2)( 1922) l. r.but the language there is very distinct, that if the father be dead the bre-thren should make him partaker of the moiety of a share.so in the second verse the words are that the brothers are to allow him to participate for half a share, and later on there is the same expression the son of the female slave participates for half a share only.r. 55 mad.a continuous concubine has the status of a son, and that he is a member of the family that the share of inheritance given to him is not merely in lieu of maintenance, but in recognition of his status as a son it is not necessary to multiply decisions.during the lifetime of his father, the law allows the illegitimate son to take( 1)( 1931) i. l.member of the family to maintenance out of the joint family property in the hands of the collaterals with whom the father was joint.1. only such share as his father may give him.but his rights are limited compared to those of a son born in wedlock.we regret our inability to accept this proposition.for, if accepted, we would be speaking in two voices.once it is established that for the purpose of succession an illegitimate son of a sudra has the status of a son and that he is entitled to succeed to his putative fathers entire self-acquired property in the absence of a son, widow, daughter or daughters son and to a share along with them, we cannot see any escape from the consequential and logical position that he shall be entitled to succeed to the other half share when succession opens after the widows death.under the hindu law, the death of the widow opens inheritance to the reversioners and the nearest heir at the time to the last full owner becomes entitled to possession.856.55 mad.or daughters son and to a share along with them, we cannot see any escape from the consequential and logical position that he shall be entitled to succeed to the other half share when succession opens after the widows death.but a reference to that judgment shows that no such proposition has been laid down therein.to be supported by the author by reference to a decision of the madras high court in karuppayee ammal v. ramaswami( 1).the reason of the decision is therefore clear and that is when a daughters son succeeds to an estate, there is no further scope for the application of the doctrine of reverter.1938 nag.it is.assuming that learned counsel for the appellant was correct in his contention, we fail to see how the said legal position would advance the appellants case, for the court of wards admittedly managed only the i. l. r.856.255. widows limited estate and it is not the case of the appellant that the

his contention, we fail to see how the said legal position would advance the appellants case, for the court of wards admittedly managed only the i. l. r.', '1959_5.txt': 'in our opinion, the high court was right in its conclusion.the learned judges of the high court were of the opinion that the word shareholder in s. 18( 5) had the same signification as the word member used in the indian companies act and that the assessee was not qualified to be considered as a shareholder, even though by a blank transfer it had, purchased the relevant shares.it was contended in the high court that inasmuch as s. 16( 2) referred to an i assessee, the assessee company was entitled to have the dividend grossed up by the addition of income-tax paid by the various companies at source and consequently to have the benefit of the credit allowed under the two remaining sections.it is itself chargeable under the act, in cull v. inland revenue commissioners( 1), lord atkin stated the law( which in substance is also the law in our country) thus my lords, it is now clearly established that in the case of a limited company the company itself is chargeable to tax on its profits, and that it pays tax in discharge of its own liability and not as agent for its shareholders at one time it was thought that the company, in paying tax, paid on behalf of the shareholder but this theory is now exploded by decisions in this house, and the position of the shareholders as to tax is as i have stated it.the position of a shareholder who gets dividend when his name stands in the register of members of the company causes no difficulty whatever.603, 636.though under( 1) 1940 a. c. 51, 56( 1939) 22 tax cas.the company recognises no person except one whose name is on the register of members, upon whom alone calls for unpaid capital can be made and to whom only the dividend declared by the company is legally payable.18( 5) and 49b( 1) to be payment by the shareholders.the share-holders, however, get the benefit of the payment of the tax by the company.buckley on the companies act, 12th edition, page 803 has pointed out that the right of a transferee is only to call upon the company to register his name and no more.-no rights arise till such registration, takes place.the learned lord justices held that under s.section 2( 16) of the indian companies act, 1913, defines share as share in the share capital of the company section 5 deals with the mode of forming incorporated companies, and in the case of companies limited by shares, the liability of the members is limited to the amounts, if any, unpaid on the shares respectively held by them.a glance at the scheme of the indian companies act, 1913, shows that the words member, shareholder and holder of a share have been used interchangeably in that act.the words holder of a share are really equal to the word shareholder and the expression holder of a share denotes, in so far as the company is concerned, only a person who, as a shareholder, has his name entered on the register of members.see nagabushanam v. ramachandra rao( 1).the transferee is entered in the register of members in respect thereof.the transferee can call upon the transferor to attend the meeting, vote according to his directions, sign documents in relation to the issuance of fresh capital, call for emergent meetings and inter alia, also compel the transferor to pay such dividend as he may have received.the words holder of a share are really equal to the word shareholder and the expression holder of a share denotes, in so far as the company is concerned, only a person who, as a shareholder, has his name entered on the register of members.( 1)( 1888) 37 ch.authorities on this point are not wanting, and indeed, in the judgment of the calcutta highthe assessee contends that the word shareholder includes even a person who holds a share as a result of a blank transfer, and does not necessarily mean a member of the company, whose name is on the register of members.the position, therefore, under the indian com-panies act, 1913, is quite clear that the expression shareholder or holder of a share in so far as that act is concerned, denotes no other person except a member.16( 2) and 18( 5) the assessee, who was a transferee on a blank transfer is entitled to the benefits of the grossing up of the dividend income.learned counsel for the assessee strenuously contends that the assessee being an owner in equity of the shares and thus also of the dividend is entitled to this benefit.117.( 5) 1940 1 ch.45 mad.court they have all been referred to.the assessee contends that the word shareholder includes even a person who holds a share as a result of a blank transfer, and does not necessarily mean a member of the company, whose name is on the register of members.they are all against the assessee.490.it is the common term used, and only means the person who holds the shares by having his name on the register.no valid reason exists why shareholder as used in s. 18( 5) should mean a person other than the one denoted by the same expression in the indian companies act, 1913.in in re wala wynaad indian gold mining company( 5), chitty, j., observed i use now myself the term which is common in the courts, i a shareholder, that means the holder of the shares.see shree shakti mills ltd. v. commissioner of income-tax( 1), jaluram bhikulal v. commissioner of income-tax( 2), arvind n. mafatlal v. incometax officer( 3) and bikaner trading co. v. commissioner of income-tax( 4).( 2) 1952 22 i. t. r.as the assessee claims to be but only a register of members.this takes us immediately to the register of members, and demonstrates that even for the purpose of the indian income-tax act, the words, member and shareholder can be read as synonymous.section 19a makes it clear, if any doubt existed, that by the term shareholder is meant the person whose name and address are entered in the register of shareholders maintained by the company.', '1960_87.txt': 'this representation was rejected.the appellant is a sugar mill in district saran in the state of bihar.when the matter came up

before this court in the bijoy cotton mills ltd. v. their workmen and another( 1) and it was held there on the language of s. 2( a)( 1) of the industrial disputes act, 1947, that before that provision could apply to a controlled industry there must be a notification by the central government for the purposes of s. 2( a)( 1) of the industrial disputes act.reliance is placed on the words concerning

to the contention raised on behalf of the mill that there was in fact no prejudice whatsoever so far as the status and emoluments of ramkrishna prasad were concerned by the creation of the new post and the appointment of babulal parekh on it, and that the tribunal was not justified in any case in granting an increment of rs.30 per menses to ramkrishna prasad.the main consideration which influenced the tribunal in passing the order which it did was that in the view of the tribunal ramkrishna prasad was superseded by babulal parekh who was first546.the tribunal has concluded from the fact that babulal.the real thing which determined the status of babulal parekh was the appointment order dated october 4, 1952, which the tribunal has accepted as correct.1955 mys.appointed as a clerk under him.this view of i. l. r.a question was certainly put to chaudhari at the end of his cross-examination that heit is, however, clear from this confusion that no importance can be attached to whether babulal parekh was marked present in the register or signed it.we cannot accept the suggestion on behalf of the respondents that the appointment order was ante-dated, for no such suggestion was made to chaudhari and the tribunal itself does not find so.the real thing which determined the status of babulal parekh was the appointment order dated october 4, 1952, which the tribunal has

appellants cannot be considered to be the persons causing obstruction.unlawful obstruction, if any, is certainly not caused by the people who carry on the trade of auctioning.if a trade like auctioning which has to be carried on as necessary for the well being of the community, some amount of noise has to be borne in at least that part of the town where such trade is ordinarily carried on.the second clause deals with the position where the conduct of any trade or occupation or the keeping of any goods or merchandise, is injurious to the health or physical comfort of the community and that in consequence such trade or occupation should be prohibited or regulated or such goods or merchandise should be removed or the keeping thereof regulated.we do not think that the orders are justified under s. 133.in our opinion therefore, the slight discomfort that may be caused to some people passing by the road or living in the neighbourhood cannot ordinarily be considered to be such

the true state of his finances and given a truthful picture of the profit and loss in his business by entering the bullion and silver at cost when he withdrew them for a purely non-business purpose and utilised them in a transaction which brought him neither income nor profit nor gain.and yet, when the reasoning of the learned attorney-general is pushed to tis logical conclusion, the form of the transcation is of its essence and its taxable or not according to the route the rice takes from the godown to the wedding feast.in our opinion, it would make no difference if the man instead of giving the feast himself hands over the rice to his daughter as a gift for the marriage festivities of her son.why should it make a difference if instead of keeping two sets of books he keeps only one?as he makes his purchases he enters his stock at the cost price on one side of the accounts.apart, however, from that the learned attorney-generals rule is equally capable of abuse.there is no case quite in

case.the conditions for the application of article 31( 4) thus stand fulfilled.all that can be said is that it is grossly inadequate and it is not the equivalent of the value of the property acquired, but this issue is not justiciable in view of the provisions of article 31( 4).the contention that there is no public purpose behind the impugned act has also to be repelled on the same reasoning as given by me in the bihar case.two further hurdles, viz., of articles 31-a and 31-b introduced by the amendments to the constitution, stand in the way of the petitioner and bar an enquiry into the question of the quantum of compensation.besides the obstacle of article 31( 4).the contention that there is no public purpose behind the impugned act has also to be repelled on the same reasoning as given by me in the bihar case.it is too late in the day to contend that reform in this directions is not for general public benefit.65, 000 as compensation to his client for property worth twenty-five lakhs of rupees was purely illusory.the next argument of mr. somayya that the act is a fraud on the constitution in that in legislating under entry 42 of list iii, it has legislated for non-payment of

accordingly dismissed but in the circumstances i make no order as to costs.195), far from supporting the contention raised, negatives it.the applicability of article 31( 4) is not limited to estates and its provisions save the law in its entirety.in my opinion, the observations in sibnath banerjees case(( 1945) l. r.72 i. a.the impugned act in this situation qua the acquisition on the eighty malguzari villages cannot be questioned on the ground that it contravenes the provisions of article 31( 2) of the constitution or any of the other provisions of part iii.the dictum of holmes c. j.it was within the competence of the government in exercise of its governmental power to enhanced land revenue, to withdraw exemption of land revenue, wherever those had been granted, and to enact other laws of a similar character.lastly, it was urged that the legislation in question was not enacted bona fide inasmuch as in 1946 the legislature having passed a resolution to end zamindaries, proceeded to enact laws with the purpose of defeating the constitutional guarantees regarding payment of compensation by various devices.there is no evidence whatsoever that all these enactments were enacted with a fraudulent design of defeating the provisions of paymentit may be mentioned that under powers of compulsory acquisition a number of properties have been nationalized in england and other countries.significance is vital, not formal it is to be gathered not simply by taking the words and a dictionary, but by considering their origin and the line of their growth, and contended that if the constitution of india was constructed in the light of these observations, then despite the express provisions of article 31( 2) it would be found that there is something pervading it which makes the obligations to pay real compensation a necessary incident of the compulsory acquisition of property.the petition is therefore dismissed.the constitution had not even come into force by the time that most of these statutes were enacted.the guarantee has no greater scope than this.it was contended that by the terms of the covenant of merger those properties were declared as the petitioners private properties and were protected from state legislation by the guarantee given in article 362 of the constitution and hence the impugned act was bad as it contravened the provisions of this article.that guarantee has been fully respected by the impugned statue as it treats treats those properties is their private properties and seeks to acquire them on thatthe properties belonging to the petitioner and acquired under the statute were originally situate in an indian state which became subsequently merged with madhya pradesh.then other acts mentioned in the earlier part of the main judgment were enacted with the same end in view.it was within the competence of the government in exercise of its governmental power to enhanced land revenue, to withdraw exemption of land revenue, wherever those had been granted, and to enact other laws of a similar character.assumption.this petition is accordingly dismissed but there will be no order of costs.317, this contention is not

guarantee has no greater scope than this.166 of 1951, i see no force in this contention, mr. swami also reiterated mr. bindras contention that the legislation was not bona fide.487 of 1951.in my opinion, the argument is based on a fallacy.mr. mukherji who appeared in this petition merely adopted the arguments taken in other petitioners.petition no.jog appeared in this petition and raised the same points as in other petitions.there will be no order as to costs.as already stated, the purpose of the act is to bring about reforms in the land tenure system of the state by establishing direct contact between the tillers of the soil and the government.that status by occupancy tenants was possible under existing statutes and that they had also the power of transfer of their holdings.no appeal, however, appears to have been actually filed presumably because the present applications under under article 32 had already been filed in this court.the present bunch of petitions has been filed in this court under article 32 of the constitutional challenged the validity of the madhya pradesh act and praying for appropriate writs, directions and orders restraining the state of madhya pradesthe high court certified under article 132( 1) that the cases involved a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of the constitution.in the circumstances, the constituent assembly passed the constitution( first amendment) act, 1951, by section 4 and 5 of which two new articles, namely, article 31-a and article 31-b were inserted into the constitution.the legal validity of the constitution( first amendment) act, 1951, which was challenged, has however, been upheld by this court and all courts must give effect to the two new articles which are now substantive parts of our constitution.re.there is no dispute as to the correctness of the dates given to us by counsel for the petitioners.learned counsel appearing for the different petitioners accepted the position that as a result of the constitutional amendments the impugned act has been removed from the operation of the provisions of the part iii of the constitution and that consequently the attract on the act will have to be founded on some other provisions of the constitution.( a) in dealing with this ground of objection it will be helpful to note the course which the bill took before it was put on the statute book.learned counsel for other petitioners adopted and in some measure reinforced the arguments of mr. b. somayya.re.nobody put forward any reasoned amendment and the trend of the speeches shows that the house accepted the bill.then followed speeches by 11 speakers congratulating the government and some of the members who took an active part in carrying, through this important measure of land reform and relief to the tillers of the soil.( a) in dealing with this ground of objection it will be helpful to note the course which the bill took before it was put on the statute book.it was referred to a select committee on 15th october 1949.there is no evidence on affidavit by anybody who was present at the meeting of the assembly held on 5th april, 1950, as to be what actually happened on that date.the objection formulated by learned counsel for the petitioners is founded is founded on the rules of procedure framed by the assembly under section 84 of the government of india act, 1953 which were continued in force until new rules were farmed under article 208 of the constitution.the petitioners rely only on the absence in the official report of proceedings of any mention of the question being put to or carried by the assembly.it is urged that the question that the bill be passed into law was not to the assembly under rule 20 and if it was at all put the result of the voting, whether by voices or division, was never announced by the speaker as required by old rule 34.of the bill as it emerged through, the house was printed on 29th april, 1950, and speaker signed a copy of the printed bill on 5th may, 1950, and certified that it had been passed by the house and forwarded it to the governor.i am not prepared to accept this contention as sound.the petitioners rely only on the absence in the official report of proceedings of any mention of the question being put to or carried by the assembly.business the onus is undoubtedly on the petitioners to allege and prove that the procedure prescribed by the rules was not followed.there can be no doubt that the memory of the speaker was fresher on the 5th may, 1950, than it was on 1st october, 1950, when he singed a bunch of reports of proceedings.therefore, as a statement of a fact more reliance must be placed on the certification of the bill than on the confirmation of the proceedings and it will not be unreasonable to hold that the omission of any mention of the question having been put to and carried by the assembly was.the petitioners as i have said, strongly rely on the official report of the proceedings.( b) article 31( 3) on which this ground of attack is based runs as follows-no such law as is referred to in clause(( see mays parliamentary practice, 14th edn p. 544).an accidental slip or omission.in british parliamentary practice the speakers authentication is taken as conclusive( see cries on statute law, 4th ed., p. 36).there can be no doubt that the memory of the speaker was fresher on the 5th may, 1950, than it was on 1st october, 1950, when he singed a bunch of reports of proceedings.therefore, it is urged that after a bill is passed by the state assembly, the governor must assent to it so that the bill becomes a law and then that law, to have effect, must be reserved for the consideration of the president.that is not so.this admittedly, not having been done, the provisions of article 31( 3) cannot be said to have been complied with and, therefore, the act cannot have any effect at all.the argument is that article 31( 3) requires that a law must be reserved for the consideration of the president.it is said that this clause postulates a lawmade by the legislature of a state.the procedure to be followed after a bill is passed by the state assembly is laid down in article 200.reference is then made to article 168 which provides that for every state there shall be a legislature which shall consist of the governor and so far as madhya pradesh is concerned, of one house, i. e.re( g) the last ground of attack is that the 80 malaguzari mahals belonging to the petitioner in petition no., 1947, increasing the land revenue of the estates, revocations of exemptions act, 1948, revoking the exemptions from land revenue enjoyed by certain proprietors and finally the impugned act, has been relied on as evidence of a systematic scheme for expropriating the zamindars and it is contended that such a conduct clearly amounts to a fraud on the constitution.i see no improper delegation of legislative power at all.it is true that section 9 of the acts does not specially indicate when the instalments will began or what the amount of each instalments will be but the section clearly contemplates that these details should be worked out by rules to be framed under section 91 of the act.72 i.the occur to me several answers to this contention.a question was raised by mr. asthana appearing for the ruler of khairagarh who is the petitioner in petition no.in that covenant the properties in question were recognised as the personal properties of the ruler as distinct from the state properties.all that the covenant does is to recognise the title of the ruler as owner of certain properties.khairagarh is one of the states which formerly fell within the eastern states agency.the guarantee or assurance to which due regard is to be had is limited to personal rights, privileges and dignities of the ruler qua a ruler.mr. b. somayya has drawn our attention to the words without prejudice to the generality of the provisions of article 31-a occurring in the beginning of article 31-b and contended that the interpretation put upon these words by the judicial committee in shibnath banerjees case(( 1945) l. r.further this article does not import any legal obligation but is an assurance only.no circumstances be acquired by the state.the fact that his personal properties are sought to be acquired on payment of compensation clearly recognises his title just as the titles of other proprietors are recognised.', '1959_26.txt': 'the finding of the appellate tribunal in their own words was-the contention of the appellants is that the

been so entrusted with the money, in breach of trust, misappropriated the amount, thus causing loss to his client.but the appellant challenged the document as a forgery in material parts, and cross-examined the complainant who had produced the document.4200/-whichin spite of the fact that the complainant was very pointedly cross-examined with a view to showing that the document placed before the court was a forgery in material parts, the complainant did not take any steps to get an expert on handwriting examined.apparently, the high court, sitting in appeal on the judgment of the acquittal, passed by the learned magistrate, was not satisfied as to the genuineness of the questioned document.otherwise it could have pronounced its judgment one way or the other, on the merits of the controversy, whether or not the prosecution had succeeded in bringing the charge home to the accused.order to substantiate the charge against him, the complainant( now respondents examined himself and a number of witnesses.in all civilised countries, criminal jurisprudence has firmly established the rule that an accused person should not be placed on trial for the same offence more thanthe interest of the accused that the whole matter should be cleared up, and no steps should be spared which might ensure complete justice between the parties.according to the respondent, the figures 4200 and the bengali word sankranta were for-geries just as at the bottom of the document the word yes and the signature of the res-pondent with date were also forgeries.it is true that expert evidence cannot always be a final settler still in a call of this kind, it is eminently desirable that the court should be assisted by a qualified expert since almost the whole case depends upon proof of the fact whether the impugned portions of that document were in the hand of the respondent comment was also made by the magistrate on the appellants failure to call expert evidence.ship between the parties it is as much necessary in the interest of, the prosecution as in.if it were an ordinary case between one litigant and another, we might have hesitated at this dis-tance of time to send the case back even though the prosecution did not avail of the opportunity of proving its own case.that being so, the high court, in our judgment, entirely misdirected itself in setting aside the order of acquittal and making an order for a fresh trial by another magistrate, simply on the ground that the case was between a lawyer and his client.the accused was thus acquitted.it was not that he proved for the examination of an expert and that opportunity had been denied to him.in this case, the complainant had the fullest opportunity of adducing all the evidence that he was advised would be necessary to prove the charge against the accused person.that court was not satisfied that evidence was adequately reliable to bring the charge home to the accused.the prosecution took its chance of having a decision in its favour on the evidence adduced by it before the trial court.apply to all criminal trials, and, in our opinion, the only.reason given by the high court for ordering retrial is against all well-established rules of criminal jurisprudence.that being so, the high court, in our judgment, entirely misdirected itself in setting aside the order of acquittal and making an order for a fresh trial by another magistrate, simply on the ground that the case was between a lawyer and his client.it had to apply the same rules of criminal jurisprudence as.', '1953_26.txt': 'what after all does consumption mean?he does not have to destroy them nor doesi now come to matters of greater detail what do the words for the purpose of consumption mean?the ban does not apply and there is no need to call in aid the explanation, for i repeat that the explanation is limited to cases which in truth and in fact take place in the course of inter-state trade and commerce.this is best understood by reference to a concrete case a, a dealer in bombay, actually delivers goods to b, a dealer in madras, for the purpose of sale by b, the madras dealer, to purchasers c, d and e in madras.it is true it makes an arbitrary selection but then almost any selection would have to be arbitrary and this is as good as any other.therefore, in my judgment, neither the sale by a to b in the illustration put nor the purchase by b from a can be taxedit all depends on how you view the matter.broadly speaking, the object here is to stop multiple taxation on any single act of sale or purchase made in the course of inter-state trade and commerce.the older they are and the more they have been used, the more valuable they become, but that would not prevent them from being consumed over again when a collector buys them for display in his house.when dealer buys from dealer that is consumption 1108 for the purposes of the purchaser dealers trade when an ultimate purchaser buys from a retailer, that is also consumption for his purposes.in its economic sense it is just the use which a purchaser chooses to make of the goods purchased for his own purposes.but when he re-exports, his sale to the outside consumer cannot be taxed if the explanation is attracted.a man who purchases a valuable piece of sculpture or painting for preservation in a national museum does not destroy it nor does he use it himself except for the purposes of presenting it to the museum.if the normal rule werebut such a construction would make the explanation useless.i think that is the reason why the words actually and consumption have been used.next, what do the words actually been delivered mean?in the course of inter-state trade and commerce.in the former class of case, the carrier would normally be regarded as the agent of the madras purchaser and the result would be that delivery would in that event be deemed to be delivery in bombay and that would give bombay the right to tax and not madras.we have a, aconsider these concrete cases.there are bound to be some in.but that would only arise in one class of case and i cannot see how inequality of this kind can be avoided in every case even on my lord the chief justices view.equalities, whichever view is taken.but such a construction would make the explanation useless.we have therefore to determine where the inter-state course ends and the intra-state course begins.( 2) 1906 a. c. 419.this case.equalities, whichever view is taken.there are bound to be some in.dealer in bombay, b, a dealer in madras, and c, a consumer also in madras.they obtain their wares from wholesale importers or large dealers in other states.that still gives a an advantage over b.in that event, b, the manufacturer in madras, pays no initiala very large volume of the feasibly taxable trade in this country, if not the bulk of it, at any rate in most states, is in the hands of retail dealers resident in the various states.that still gives a an advantage over b.ay, there is only one tax in the transaction on my lords view.but apart from this, the matter is, i think, largely theoretical save perhaps in a few exceptional cases.the price the ultimate consumer pays is the same wherever he purchases in a given area.but that did not prevent this court from holding in the state of travancore-cochin others v. the bombay co. ltd.( 1) that the sale which occasioned his import is free of tax.in this class of case, the trade usually adjusts its own differences by allowing the local dealer a discount in fact, in the case of many commodities, local dealers have to give an undertaking not to sell below a certain price in order to maintain a steady price level over the local market and avoid cut throat competition.most people prefer to pay the extra price and save themselves endlessif that is the normal way in which trade and commerce in that particular line of goods flows across the boundary, then that would, in my opinion, be a sale in the course ofthe taxing sections 5 and 10 empower a levy of tax on all sales made within the state of bombay when the turnover reaches a certain figure.1112, 1112 of bombay will not prevent it from being a sale effected in the course of inter-state trade or commerce or in the course of export or import.i will assume that delivery is made to b himself in bombay and that he carries the goods across in person.even when the whole transaction of sale is constituted in bombay in the sense that every essential ingredient necessary to constitute a sale takes place there,( that is to say, even when the explanation is not called into play), the sale would, given other considerations, be in the course of export or import or in the course of inter-state trade or commerce.the price the ultimate consumer pays is the same wherever he purchases in a given area.it was argued that the rules save the act in the following way.1113 the act came into force on 9th october, 1952, with the exception of the taxing sections.inter-state trade and commerce despite the facts, including delivery, mentioned above.so long as the ban imposed by clause( 2) remains the situs of the sale and the place of delivery are not material provided the sale is caught up in the vortex of inter-state trade and commerce.it embodies almost word for word every provision of the explanation to article 286( 1)( a).on this view, the preamble to the act and the short title which limit the ambit of the law to the levy of tax on sales and purchases of goods in the state of bombay, do not serve to save the act, nor do the definitions of the words sale, dealer and turnover.actually, explanation( 2) to the definition of sale directly offends clause( 2) of article 286.i can understand this court saving to a petitioner you are not yet hurt by this act nor is there any immediate likelihood of your being hurt and until.say the rules were to be amended tomorrow by striking out these saving clauses, which would be ultra vires, the act or the rules?rules save the act in the following way.it would be impossible to hold that the rules are ultra vires the act, for they would not in the event i am contemplating travel one whit beyond the act.i need not examine the rules for this purpose.it would, in my judgment, be no more competent for a rule-making authority to do that than it would have been competent for it to validate this act if the rules had been brought into 1114 being even one day after sections 5 and 10 came into force.and if the act is held to be ultra vires in an event like that, would it be competent to the rule-making authority to come to the rescue of the legislature and rehabilitate the act by re-enacting the rules which it had deleted a few days before?while agreeing in the main with the conclusions reached therein i am however unablei have now to consider two more points.i would therefore hold that the bombay sales tax act, 1952( bombay act no.bhagwati j.-i had the benefit of reading the judgment just delivered by my lord the chief justice.offending provisions can be struck out but if we do that the whole act goes because the defect here is that all sales are permitted to be taxed provided they are within the state of bombay, and the rulemaking authority is not restricted to taxation which is constitutionally permissible.on the question of severability, i cannot see how the good can be separated from the bad in this case even if the explanation to section 2( 14) be expunged unless the constitution be read as part of the act and we are to read into the act some such provision as follows notwithstanding anything which is said in any part of this act, all sales which the state is prohibited to tax under the constitution are excluded from the scope of this act.with all respect to the american judges who hold that view, i would prefer not to make exceptions.to subscribe to the reasoning as also the construction put upon the explanation to article 286( 1)( a).whereas before the constitution the taxing power could be exercised by reason of a sufficientmake exceptions.these were the three categories of sales or purchases which came within the ban imposed by article the phraseology used in the article laid particular stress on the fact that the sale or purchase should take place so as to fall within one or the other of these categories.that power has got to be widely construed and it would embrace the power to tax the sales or purchases of goods by reason of a sufficient territorial connection between the taxing state and what it seeks to tax.this was also the position which obtained before the constitution and was responsible for double or multiple taxation of the same transaction by different states.once the transfer of ownership or the passing of the property in the goods was accepted as the sole criterion of taxability it was not necessary at all to define what was a sale or purchase which took place 1117 inside the state.the intention was that the sale or purchase should take place, i. e., should be completed either outside the state or in the course of import or export or in the course of interstate trade or commerce.whether a sale or purchase took place inside the state could be determined by applying the general law relating to the sale of goods and ascertaining where the transfer of ownership took place or the property in the goods passed.they wanted to give the delivery state in that event the power to tax such sale or purchase and therefore introduced by the explanation to article 286( 1)( a) a legal fiction by which( 1) 1898 a. c. 200.( 2) 1906 a. c. 419.what otherwise would have been a sale or purchase which took place outside the state within the meaning of article 286( 1)( a) was thus by legal fiction deemed to have taken place inside the delivery state, thus assimilating the position to a sale or purchase which took place inside the delivery state enabling the delivery state to tax the sale or purchase in question. thisit would be surprising 1119 to find a definition of a transaction of sale or purchase which takes place inside the state given in the manner in which it is alleged to have been done in the explanation covering only those transactions of sale or purchase in which the goods have actually been delivered in the delivery state as a direct result of such sale or purchase for the purpose of consumption in that state.they do not comprise all the transactions of sale or purchase which take place inside the state because besides those there are a large number of transactions of sale or purchase which take place inside the state and in which no element of inter-state trade or commerce enters the transaction.what was a sale or purchase which took place outside the state was by reason of the explanation and the legal fiction enacted therein deemed to be a sale or purchase which took place inside the state so as to enable the delivery state to tax the sale or purchase in question.the transactions of sale or purchase which take place between dealers and dealers and dealers and customers all within the state are really comprised in the category of transactions of sale or purchase which take place inside the state and these transactions do not at all fall within the purview of the explanation.it would be a more natural way of reading the non-obstante clause to read into it an intention to state what according to the constitution makers was the basic idea of fixing the situs or the location of the sale or purchase in the place where the transfer of ownership took place or the property in the goods passed and to indicate that notwithstanding that fact a sale or purchase which fell within the category mentioned in the explanation was none, the, less to be deemed to have taken place inside the delivery state.obstante clause is to ignore the facts and do violence to the whole conception underlying the incorporation of the non-obstante clause in the explanation.the object and purpose of the explanation could only to be to deem such purchase or sale by reason of the legal fiction to have taken place in the delivery state so as to enable the delivery state also to tax the sale oror purchase will be deemed to have taken 1121 place inside the delivery state.the object of the explanation is not and could not be to take away the right which the state in which the property in the goods passed had to tax the sale or purchase which took place inside that state.in order to arrive at a conclusion whether the object and purpose of the explanation was to enable the delivery state to tax such sales or purchases either in addition to the state in which the property in the goods had passed or in substitution thereof one has got to bear in mind the basic idea that a state would normally be entitled to tax a sale or purchase where such sale or purchase took place inside the state except in cases covered by article 286( 1)( b) and article 286( 2).merely because a book is by a legal fiction deemed to be in the book case b it does not necessarily ceasethe explanation therefore covers only those cases where as-a direct result of the saledelivery of goods for the purpose of consumption in the delivery state therefore means the delivery for the purpose of using by the consumer and it has no application to the case of a dealer purchasing the 1124 goods across the border for dealing with or disposing of the same in the ordinary course of trade.a dealer who deals with the goods after purchasing the same does not consume the goods.he is not a consumer of those goods.it is only a transaction of sale or purchase directly results in the delivery of goods 1123 for the purpose of consumption in the delivery state that comes within the category of transactions covered by the explanation.it is not every transaction which results in the goods being delivered across the border that comes within this category.it is a well-known rule of the interpretation of statutes that a particular enactment is not repealed by a general enactment in the same statute.( beal on the cardinal rules of legal interpretation, 3rd edition, part vii, section ix, page 516).so far however as the delivery state is concerned the explanation empowers the delivery state to tax such transaction and if article 286( 2) be construed as imposing a ban on the taxation of such sale or purchase it will be tantamount to the giving of the right to tax by one hand and the taking away of it by another.so far as the state in which the property in the goods has passed is concerned it could certainly not tax the sale or purchase in question because the transaction of sale or purchase so far as the particular state is concerned takes place in the course of inter-state trade or commerce and could not be subjected to the imposition of tax except in so far as parliament might by law otherwise provide.do so to reconcile the provisions of the explanation to article 286( 1)( a) and article 286( 2).it is a well-known rule of the interpretation of statutes that a particular enactment is not repealed by a general enactment in the same statute.to the same effect also are the observations of quain j. in dryden v. overseers of putney( 2) quoted at page 426 of the same work-it may be laid down as a rule for the construction of statutes, that where a special provision and a general provision are inserted which cover the same subjectmatter, a case falling within the words of the special provision must be governed thereby and not by the terms of the general provision.churchill v. crease( 1).the two concepts are thus entirely different.this aspect was however not stressed or presented during the course of the arguments and i would prefer not to express any opinion on the scope or meaning of article 304.d. 232 at p 426, 1127 which are included in part xiii under the captiontrade, commerce and intercourse within the territory of india.i would therefore base my, construction of the explanation to article 286( 1)( a) and article 286( 2) on the rule as to the interpretation of statutes which i have referred to above, lifting the transaction of sale or purchase covered bycategory of transactions, in the course of inter-state trade or commerce covered by article 286( 2) and assimilated to transactions of sale or purchase which take place inside the state thus acquiring an intrastate character so far as the delivery state is concerned.in the result the declaration made by the court below will be seti agree that the bombay sales tax act, 1952, and the rules made, thereunder except rule 5( 2)( 1) do not contravene the provisions of article 286, that rule 5( 2)( 1) is clearly severable and can be ignored, that there is no substance in the contention of shri seervai that there is a violation of the fundamental rights guaranteed under article 14 and that the taxation statutes should be construed in a manner so as to allow the statute itself to stand, the taxing authority being prevented by injunction from imposing the tax on subjects excluded by the constitution from the purview of taxation by the state.held that both the states could tax or neither of them could tax such sale or purchase.the state in which the property in the goods passes would not be able to tax such sale or purchase in the absence of a provision enacted by law by parliament within the meaning of article 286( 2).', '2003_794.txt': 'same.therefore this decision in isha marbles cannot be taken advantage of by the appellant at all in this case.it is brought to our notice that this aspect is under consideration in another matter before this court.the argument advanced by the appellant that sale having taken place under

are members of the plaintiffs family while the third defendant is the state of bombay( province of bombay at the date of the suit).a question of impartibility was raised but the bombay high court declared that the property in british india was partible.they further declared that bhujangrao i was the head of the family and as such was entitled to a special assignment which was not to exceed a quarter share, for the expenses and duties which might devolve on him by virtue of his position, and that after this had been set aside each of the three brothers was entitled to an equal one-third share in the landed property in india.h. c. r. 161.p-53 shows that the estate consisted of villages.the duties enumerated at page 170 included, the keeping up of armed retainers for the fort of gajendragad, and for the improvement of that village, which was the chief seat of this branch of the ghorpade family, and also to enable him to distribute on ceremonial occasions the customary presents to the junior members of the family.in compliance with this, the common ancestor shown at the head of the genealogical tree set out above was recognised by the british government as the

emphasised by government in the same year on the 22nd august, 1882.it should however be clearly understood that the decision of the high court in not to be held as a precedent and that no partition of the jahagir estate to be continued to the adopted son will ever be allowed.the property should be dealt with like other saranjams in the political department.this prayer was refused and government stated it should be plainly under that government allow the adoption to be made only in consideration of bhujangrao one share as well as the portion assigned to him as head of the family being continued to the adopted son as indivisible jahagir estate descending in the line of male heirs in the order of primogeniture and subject to no terms whatsoever as to the enjoyment of the same by krishnabai during her lifetime.the portions applicable here were as follows-saranjams shall ordinarily be continued in accordance with the decision already passed by government in each case.after due consideration he thought that the interest of government and the saranjamdar would be sufficiently safeguarded by allowing the same position to continue.h. c. r. 161, malojirao alone separated and the other two brothers continued joint.were not affected.he ordered the entries to be made accordingly.the district deputy collector, after inspecting the records, found that the name of the khatedar

this, for they filed suit no.the collector should take steps to place the saranjamdar in possession of the villages of the saranjam estate which were in possession of the deceased saranjamdar.that in my opinion is an idle contention in view of paragraphs 9 and 12 of the plaint and reliefs( a) and( d).in any event, mr. somayya was asked whether he would strike out the third defendant and those portions of the plaint which sought relief against it.the first court dismissed the plaintiffs claim on the merits holding that government had the right to amend its resolution in the way it did.that it be declared that defendant 3( government) have no right to change the resolution no.sole saranjamdar in the revenue records and that the assignments held by defendants 1 and 2 are held by them as mere potgi holders.it is impossible to contend that this is not a claim relating to lands held as saranjam.it was next argued that if that be the case the claim against government can be dismissed and the plaintiff can at least be given the reliefs claimed against the other two defendants.in my opinion this is not a suit in which the rights claimed against the other defendants can be divorced from the claim against government and considered separately.that resolution directly relates to the land because it directs that the gajendragad saranjam he resumed and the collector is directed to take steps to place the saranjamdar in possession of the village of the saranjam estate etc.paragraphs 9 and 12 of the plaint and reliefs( a) and( d).( it is to be observed that a resumption under rule ix can only be of the land because the rule directs that when the saranjam is resumed government itself shall make provisions for the maintenance of those entitled to it out of the revenues of the saranjam so resumed.he said he was not prepared to do so.in any event, if the claim against government is to be ignored it can only be on the basis that its orders cannot be challenged and if the orders stand it is evident that the plaintiff can have no hope of success because both sides hold their respective properties on the basis of those orders.one of those rights, as we have been from rules vii and ix, is to take the revenues of the entire estate in order that he might fulfil his obligation regarding the payment of maintenance to certain members of the family and if the defendants claim to hold their lands under the orders of government and the plaintiff insists on retaining government as a party in order that it may be bound by the decree he wants against the other defendants it is obvious that his claim against these defendants cannot be separated from his claim against the government.claim relating to lands held as saranjam.these, it was contended, do not relate to land and in any event are not claims against the crown.it was next argued that if that be the case the claim against government can be dismissed and the plaintiff can at least be given the reliefs claimed against the other two defendants.plaintiff sued government and the second defendant and sought a declaration and injunction.in my opinion, this decision does not apply here.but, if they remain a party, it seems to me that there is a claim against them relating to property appertaining to the office of an hereditary officer, although no doubt it is quite true that the appellant does not desire to get any order against the government as to the way in which the property should be dealt with or anything of the sort, and he only wants a declaration as to his title which will bind government.103) that the courts have jurisdiction to decide whether government acted in excess of its powers and that that question must be decided first.that provides that-no civil court shall
