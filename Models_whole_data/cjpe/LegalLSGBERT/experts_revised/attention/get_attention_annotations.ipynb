that the person who took the debentures was the party who sold the ordinary shares. it cannot be disputed that if the debentures were held by a third party, the interest payable on the same would be

preferring any appeal and therefore, the matters conclude by it are not open to challenge in an appeal against the final decree. further, a preliminary decree cannot be equated with an interlocutory order within the meaning of s. 105, code of civil procedure. it will thus be seen that the decision relied upon has no application to the facts of this case. our conclusion, therefore, is that in this case the sale made by the official receiver during the insolvency of the appellants father was the subject of a final decision by a competent court inasmuch as that court decided that the sale was of no avail to the purchaser at the official receiver had no power to effect that sale. nothing more was required to be established by the appellants before being entitled to the protection of the first

is a practising lawyer does not entitle him to any preferential treatment when he is hauled up on a criminal charge, even as he is not subject to any additional disability because the cam was between a lawyer and his client. there was no relationship of lawyer and client so far as the criminal case was concerned.',\n"," '1953_26.txt': '1) is clearly severable and can be ignored, that there is no substance in the contention of shri seervai that there is a violation of the fundamental rights guaranteed under article 14 and that the taxation statutes should be construed in a manner so as to allow the statute itself to stand, the taxing authority being prevented by injunction from imposing the tax on subjects excluded by the constitution from the purview of taxation by the state. in the result the declaration made by the court below will be set aside, the writ issued by it will be quashed and the state of bombay will be prohibited from imposing or authorising the imposition of a tax on sales or purchases which according to the interpretation put above on article 286 are excluded from the purview 1129 of taxation by the state of bombay.',\n"," '2003_794.txt': 'recovery of the excise dues from the assets owned by a predecessor and on his liabilities being assessed could be recovered even from the successor. the argument advanced by the appellant that sale having taken place under the state act free of encumbrances and the transferor s rights or liabilities cannot be that of transferee does not hold good. section 29 2 of the state act makes it clear that the property pledged mortgaged hypothecated or assigned to the financial corporation can be brought to sale and such a sale if resulted in transfer of property shall vest in the successor all rights in the property transferred as if the transfer has been made by the owner of the property. when sale made by the corporation is deemed to be a sale made by the owner of the property necessarily rule 230 2 of the central excise rules would be attracted. we are not impressed with the argument that the state act is a special enactment and the same would prevail over the central excise act. each of them is a special enactment and unless in the operation of the same any conflict arises this aspect need not be examined. in this case no such conflict arises between the corporation and the excise department. hence it is unnecessary to examine this aspect of the matter.',\n"," '1952_75.txt': 'falling under section 4( b) of the bombay revenue jurisdiction act of 1876. that provides that-no civil court shall exercise jurisdiction as to( b) objections to the amount or incidence of any assessment of land revenue authorised by the provincial government. as pointed out by strangman k. c. on behalf of the plaintiff respondent, authorised must mean duly authorised and in that particular case the impugned assessment would not be duly authorised if the government resolution of 4-1930 purporting to treat the agreement relied on by the respondent as cancelled and authorising the levy of the full assessment was ultra vires under section 211 of the land revenue code. thus, before the exclusion of the civil courts jurisdiction under section 4( b) could come into play, the court had to determine the issue of ultra vires. consequently, their lordships held that that question was outside the scope of the bar. but the position here is different. we are concerned here with section 4( a) under that no question about an authorised act of government arises. the section is general and bars all claims against the crown relating to lands held as saranjam. that is to say, even if the government act is relation to such lands was ultra vires, a claim impugning the validity of such an act would fall within the scope of the exclusion in clause( a) provided it relates to such land. there is a difference of opinion in the bombay high court as to whether section 4 is attracted if the only relief sought against government is a declaration. one set of decision holds that that does not amount to a claim against government. dattatraya vishwanath v. the secretary of state for india i. l. r. 1948 bom. 809 at 820 is typical of that view.',\n"," '1959_189.txt': 'the said question to the high court the appellant approached the high court, the high court should, in the exercise of its jurisdiction
