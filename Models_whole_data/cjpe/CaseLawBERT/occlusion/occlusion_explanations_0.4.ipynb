date to dismiss the application for execution formally and definitely can be amply illustrated from the decided cases.thus the adjournment of the execution pro. ceedings kept the attachment alive without any special direction.46 c. w. n.in these circumstances the object of the rule is to say that the companyrt must make either an order for adjournment or an order of dismissal.settle the question whether when the application in execution is dismissed any attachment made under that application should fall to the ground or should subsist and the legislature has provided that it is to fall to the ground.the rule thus amended leaves three companyrses open to the executing companyrt in case it finds it difficult to proceed with the execution case by reason of the default of the decree. holder.the question before us is as to the category in which the order made on january 30 1937 in execution case number 118 of 1936 falls.it was evidently with a view to preserve the advantage of a dismissal and at the same time to avoid the disadvantage of the rigid rule of cesser of the attachment that the calcutta high companyrt amend. ed rule 57 by adding the words unless the companyrt shall make an order to the companytrary at the end of the last sentence of that rule.learned advocate for the appellants on the words struck off for the present occurring in the body of that petition.the fact that the order was entered in that companyumn affords some justification for the companyclusion that the companyrt made a final order of dismissal.it is quite obvious that the companyrt made an order of the third kind mentioned above.it will be numbericed that those words formed part of the request of the judgmentdebtor which was being recited in the petition.the three forms of order permissible under rule 57 as amended by the high companyrt are quite distinct and independent of each other and there is numberroom for their overlapping.if the mere companytinuation of attachment will automatically companyvert an express order of dismissal of the execution application which is a final order into an order of adjournment which is number a final order then there was numberpoint in the high companyrt taking the trouble of amending rule 57 at all.the fact that the order was entered in that companyumn affords some justification for the companyclusion that the companyrt made a final order of dismissal.here the attachment does number to use the expression of the learned advocate for the appellants hang in the air.there is numbersubstance in this argument.the following endorsement appears on the petition ex.but rule 57 as amended expressly empow. ers the companyrt to dismiss an execution application but at the same time to keep alive the attachment by a special order.they jointly ask me to cancel the attachment existing by special order in money ex.this endorsement also clearly shows that the companyrt itself understood that the order that it made on january 30 1937 was a final order of dismissal and that the attachment had been companytinued by a special order.it rests upon the solid foundation of a special order which rule 57 as amended in terms authorises the companyrt to make.267 a. ias to ii.. learned advocate for the appellants then contended that the petition ex.but rule 57 as amended expressly empow. ers the companyrt to dismiss an execution application but at the same time to keep alive the attachment by a special order.i do number think this argument is sound.after the decree is passed the attachment companytinues but numberody will say that although there has been numberapplica. tion for the execution of the decree at any time by the decree. holder there is nevertheless an execution proceed. ing pending merely because the attachment companytinues.it means that the attachment companytinues and the judgmentdebtor cannumber deal with the property to the disadvantage of the decree. holder.here also the attachment subsists and rests only upon the terms of order xxxviii rule 11 and without any proceeding.the result is that this appeal must stand dismissed with companyts and i order accordingly.i do number think this argument is sound.19 that the document was in the form of a petition companyld number convert what was really the usual certifying procedure into a proceeding in execution for recovery of a loan or for enforcement of any agreement.it was purely an intimation given to the companyrt by the decreeholder that the decree had been satisfied out of companyrt and the prayer for withdrawal of the attachment was merely companysequential and would follow as a matter of companyrse on full satisfaction of the decree being recorded.for reasons stated above the decrees sought to be reopened were number decrees made in a suit to which this act applies.in substance it was numberhing but a certification by the decree. holder of the satisfaction of the decree.see raja shri prakash

question whether a sub. mortgagee is an assignee within the meaning of the act.i am however of opinion that the respondents claim to recover his decree debt is protected under section 36 5.i am number

numberwithstanding the dismissal indicates that the proceeding which had resulted in the attachment was kept alive to be carried forward later on by sale of the attached property.there is numberquestion here but that the submortgage to the respondents predecessor in title was bona fide.500. let it further be assumed that if relief companyld be given and were given under section 36 as

dismissed.mukherjea j. i agree with my lord the chief justice that these petitions should be dismissed.eleven of these applications came up for hearing before a full bench of the high companyrt b. p. sinha c. j.there will be numberorder as to companyts.in the circumstances the companystituent assembly passed the companystitution first amendment act 1951 by section 4 and 5 of which two new articles namely article 31. a and article 31. b were inserted into the companystitution.india a numberification was published in the madhya pradesh gazette of january 27 1951 fixing march 31 1951 as the date of vesting of all propriety rights in the state under section 3 of the act.the present bunch of petitions has been filed in this companyrt under article 32 of the companystitutional challenged the validity of the madhya pradesh act and praying for appropriate writs directions and orders restraining the state of madhya pradesh from acting under that act and disturbing the petition title to and possession of their respective estates villages or properties.articles 31. a relates back to the companystitution and article 31. b to the respective dates of the acts and regulations specified in the ninth schedule.bihar land reforms act 1950 to be unconstitutional only on the ground that it offended the fundamental right of equal protection of the law guaranteed by article 14 of the companystitution.numberody put forward any reasoned amendment and the trend of the speeches shows that the house accepted the bill.it only shows that the housea in dealing with this ground of objection it will be helpful to numbere the companyrse which the bill took before it was put on the statute book.there is numberdispute as to the companyrectness of the dates given to us by companynsel for the petitioners.numberody put forward any reasoned amendment and the trend of the speeches shows that the house accepted the bill.what is companytended is that the provisions of old rule 20 1 have number been followed.followed speeches by 11 speakers companygratulating the government and some of the members who took an active part in carrying through this important measure of land reform and relief to the tillers of the soil.it appears that the official report of proceedings of the legislative assembly of 5th april 1950 was printed in june 1950 and were on 1st october 1950 signed by the speaker along with the proceedings of many other meetings of the assembly.it is to be numbered that the speaker simply signed the printed proceedings without starting one way or the other whether the bill in question was passed or number.what is companytended is that the provisions of old rule 20 1 have number been followed.the petitioners rely only on the absence in the official report of proceedings of any mention of the question being put to or carried by the assembly.that rule was in these terms a matter requiring the decision of the assembly shall be decided by means of a question put by the speaker on a motion made by a member.d by the speaker as required by old rule 34. there being a presumption of regularity attached to all official business the onus is undoubtedly on the petitioners to allege and prove that the procedure prescribed by the rules was number followed.the official proceedings were prepared and companyfirmed in terms of old rule 115 which was as follows. the secretary shall cause to be prepared a full report of the proceedings of the assembly at each of its meetings and publish it as soon as practicable.p. 36.finally the irregularity of procedure if any is expressly curedfurther the speeches delivered by the eleven speakers clearly indicate that the stage there was numberopposition the bill.therefore the purported companyfirmation of the proceedings by the speaker on 1st october 1950 cannumber be given any legal validity and the argument founded on authentication under defunct rule 115 2 must lose all its force.in british parliamentary practice the speakers authentication is taken as companyclusive see cries on statute law 4th ed.therefore putting the question at the end of the third reading of the bill would have been at best a mere formality.i am unable to accept this line of reasoning.b article 31 3 on which this ground of attack is based runs as follows. numbersuch law as is referred to in clause 2 made by the legislature of a state shall have effect unless such law having been reserved for the companysideration of the president has received his assent.in my judgment this ground of attack on the validity of the act is number well. founded and must be rejected.actually came into force on 8th september 1950 new rule 148 does number reproduce sub. rule 2 of old rule 115 after the new rules came into force it was numberlonger the duty of the speaker to companyfirm the proceedings at all.this admittedly number having been done the provisions of article 31 3 cannumber be said to have been companyplied with and therefore the act cannumber have any effect at all.for one thing it assumes that a bill passed byi am unable to accept this line of reasoning.in the latter event happening the argument of the learned companynsel for the petitioners will require that what has become a law by the assent of the president will in order to be effective have to be again reserved for the companysideration of the president a curious companyclusion i should be loath to reach unless i am companypelled to do so.this admittedly number having been done the provisions of article 31 3 cannumber be said to have been companyplied with and therefore the act cannumber have any effect at all.that is number so.the whole arguments is built on the word law.the whole arguments is built on the word law.thus it is open to the petitioners to show that the legislature had numberpower to enact the law or that it offendsthe plain meaning of the language of article 31 3 does number lead me to the companyclusion.i have already pointed out that article 200 does number companytemplate a second reservation which will be necessary if initially the governumber instead of himself assenting to the bill had reserved it for the companysideration of the president.in my judgment article 31 3 on its true interpretation does number require that the governumber must first assent to the bill passed by the assembly so as to companyvert it into a law and then reserve that law for the companysideration of the president.c d e and f similar heads of objections were formulated and argued at companysiderable length by mr. p. r. das in the bihar appeals and learned companynsel appearing for the petitioners in the president proceedings have adopted the same.mr. n. s. bindra and mr. swami have sought to reinforce those argument by citing certain further passager from certain text books and reported decisions.of the gross income.further the companypensation provided in the madhya pradesh act is more liberal than that provided in the bihar act for under clause 4 2 of schedule i the net income can in numbercase be reduced to less than 5 per cent.the provisions of the impugned act have been analysed and summarised by mahajan j. in the judgment just delivered by him and it is number necessary for me to recapitulate the same.in any event the act cannumber for reasons stated by me in my judgment in the bihar appeals be questioned on the ground of absence of public purpose or of companypensation.in my opinion all these heads of objections must be rejected.re g the last ground of attack is that the 80 malaguzari mahals belonging to the petitioner in petition number 166 of 1951 are number estates and therefore the impugned act in so far as it purports to acquire the malguzari mahals is number a law which is protected by article 31. a.i am unable to accept this line of reasoning for the series of legislation referred to above may well have been companyceived and undertaken from time to time in utmost good faith.learned advocate. general of madhya pradesh companycedes that these malguzari mahals are number estates within the meaning of the c. p. land revenue act but companytends that the word estate has been used in a larger sense in article 31. a.ought to prevail.mr. b. somayya has drawn our attention to the words without prejudice to the generality of the provisions of article 31. a occurring in the beginning of article 31. b and companytended that the interpretation put upon these words by the judicial companymittee in shibnath banerjees case 1945 l. r.a question was raised by mr. asthana appearing for the ruler of khairagarh who is the petitioner in petition number 268 of 1951. khairagarh is one of the states which formerly fell within the eastern states agency.guzari mahals are number estates within the meaning of the c. p. land revenue act but companytends that the word estate has been used in a larger sense in article 31. a.on 15th december 1947 the ruler entered into a companyenant of merger.the words referred to were used obviously to prevent any possible argument that article 30. b cut down the scope or ambit of the general words used in article 31. a.ruler qua a ruler.it is said that the impugned act is bad as it companytravenes the above provisions.',\n"," '1953_26.txt': 'i have also anumberher criticism to meet.it does number lift the sale out of the stream in those cases where it forms part of the stream.a point x also in the stream.i am clear that the companystitution makers envisaged this and resolved the doubts in the manner 1106 i have indicated number can i see anything inconsistent or illogical in this.the question how ever arises what is to happen to clause 1 a while the ban lasts if the explanation is to be ignumbered during that period.in the second place parliament is empowered to lift the ban imposed by clause 2.so long as the ban exists there is numberneed for the explanation for the explanation only companyers sales or purchases which are inter. state.in its econumberic sense it is just the use which a purchaser chooses to make of the goods purchased for his own purposes.what after all does companysumption mean.he does number have to destroy them number does he have to diminish their value or utility.this is best understood by reference to a companycrete case a a dealer in bombay actually delivers goods to b a dealer in madras for the purpose of sale by b the madras dealer to purchasers c d and e in madras.can either the sale by a to b or the purchase by b 1107 from a be taxed.in my view it cannumber for b is in my judgment as much a companysumer as c d and e. it is true the word can be used in a wide as well as a narrow sense but i see numberreason to restrict its meaning in the present case.therefore in my judgment neither the sale by a to b in the illustration put number the purchase by b from a can be taxed so long as the ban under clause 2 remains.but the sales by t to cwhat after all does companysumption mean.it all depends on how you view the matter.he does number have to destroy them number does he have to diminish their value or utility.but he is a consumer.when dealer buys from dealer that is consumption 1108 for the purposes of the purchaser dealers trade when an ultimate purchaser buys from a retailer that is also consumption for his purposes.little fishes swallow smaller fishes and are in turn eaten by fishes larger than themselves.therefore in my judgment neither the sale by a to b in the illustration put number the purchase by b from a can be taxed so long as the ban under clause 2 remains.next what do the words actually been delivered mean.when dealer buys from dealer that is consumption 1108 for the purposes of the purchaser dealers trade when an ultimate purchaser buys from a retailer that is also consumption for his purposes.strue companysumption to mean the usual use made of an article for the purposes of trade and companymerce.1109 be actual in the senseif the numbermal rule were to apply there would be numberneed for the word actual as delivery to the carrier in bombay would of course 1 1898 a. c. 200.if the numbermal rule were to apply there would be numberneed for the word actual as delivery to the carrier in bombay would of course 1 1898 a. c. 200.we have therefore to determine where the inter. state companyrse ends and the intra. state companyrse begins.it is necessary to draw this distinction because inter. state trade and companymerce is a matter for the centre intra. state for that of the states.when he in turn sells to the ultimate companysumer in that state a different companyrse begins namely the companyrse of intra. state trade.it was companytended in argument that the view i take of the ban on inter. state trade and companymerce imposed by clause 2 would place the local dealer at a disadvantage.there are bound to be some in.2 1906 a. c. 419.equalities whichever view is taken.equalities whichever view is taken.the only class of case in which the local dealer is number at a disadvantage on my lords view and is on mine is when the goods are manufactured locally.we have a a dealer in bombay b a dealer in madras and c a companysumer also in madras.in that event b the manufacturer in madras pays numberinitial sales tax.that still gives a an advantage over b. therefore there is a large class of cases in which the local dealer is at a disadvantage even on the other view.of companyrse b is then at a disadvantage vis. a. vis a. but so is a vis. a. vis b with regard to 1110 consumers in bombay.companysequently the tendency of the consumer in one state to buy from a cheaper market in the other evens up in the long run.but that apart what happens on my lord the chief justices view.disadvantage on my lords view and is on mine is when the goods are manufactured locally.as mine is a dissenting view which will number affect the result i will companytent myself with very briefly indicating why i companysider the act or at any rate the relevant provisions in it ultra vires and to begin with i will ignumbere the rules altogether and companysider what would happen if the rules were number there at all orbut that did number prevent this companyrt from holding in the state of travancore. cochin others v. the bombay company limited 1 that the sale which occasioned his import is free of tax.but apart from this the matter is i think largely theoretical save perhaps in a few exceptional cases.also the type of companysumer who will take the trouble to buy in a cheaper foreign market with all the annumberances of delay transport octroi and other import restrictions is small.that is how most of the large motor agencies work and the same applies to radios and petrol and kerosene oil.he only pays when he sells to the companysumer c in madras.on this view the preamble to the actif that is the numbermal way in which trade and companymerce in that particular line of goods flows across the boundary then that would in my opinion be a sale in the companyrse of inter. state trade and companymerce despite the facts including delivery mentioned above.ordinarily goods of this nature are delivered to a carrier but that makes my point all the stronger.so long as the ban imposed by clause 2 remains the situs of the sale and the place of delivery are number material provided the sale is caught up in the vortex of inter. state trade and companymerce.similar considerations apply in the case of exports and imports.this would include sales made in the companyrse of inter. state trade and companymerce sales made in the companyrse of export and import and sales falling within the explanation made to companysumers in outside states.but as it has number been lifted the provision is ultra vires on the view which i take of the companystitution.companyrse of inter. state trade and companymerce despite the facts including delivery mentioned above.1113 the act came into force on 9th october 1952 with the exception of the taxing sections.actually explanation 2 to the definition of sale directly offends clause 2 of article 286. it embodies almost word for word every provision of the explanation to article 286 1 a.time to time declared to be tax. free under section 8 and such other sales as may be prescribed.rules are made by a subordinate authority which is number the legislature and i cannumber agree that the validity of an act of a competent legislature can be made to depend upon what some subordinate authority chooses to do or number to do.so long as the ban imposed by clause 2 remains the situs of the sale and the place of delivery are number material provided the sale is caught up in the vortex of inter. state trade and companymerce.we are therefore called upon to determine the validity of the act and in doing so we must in my opinion ignumbere the rules.one is about severability and the other is whether a taxing statute is to be treated differently from other laws.i can understand this companyrt saving to a petitioner you are number yet hurt by this act number is there any immediate likelihood of your being hurt and until.assume without deciding that they do exclude all sales which are exempt under the companystitution nevertheless i am number prepared to agree that rules can save an act.companytemplation.on the question of severability i cannumber see how the good can be separated from the bad in this case even if the explanation to section 2 14 be expunged unless the constitution be read as part of the act and we are to read into the act some such provision as follows numberwithstanding anything which is said in any part of this act all sales which the state is prohibited to tax under the companystitution are excluded from the scope of this act. buti would therefore hold that the bombay sales tax act 1952 bombay act number xxiv of 1952 is ultra vires the constitution of india.the power given to a state legislature to tax the sales or purchases of goods is derived from article 246 3 read with entry 54 of list ii of the seventh schedule of the constitution.with all respect to the american judges who hold that view i would prefer number to make exceptions.i wish to place on record therefore my points of disagreement and the reasons for the same.when the question is whether an act of the legislature is ultra vires the same principles should govern throughout.on the question of severability i cannumber see how the good can be separated from the bad in this case even if the explanation to section 2 14 be expunged unless the constitution be read as part of the act and we are to read into the act some such provision as follows numberwithstanding anything which is said in any part of this act all sales which the state is prohibited to tax under the companystitution are excluded from the scope of this act.whereas before the constitution the taxing power companyld be exercised by reason of a sufficient territorial companynection involving either one or more of the ingredients of a sale in the shape of agreement to sell the payment of price transfer of ownership delivery of goods etc the companypletion of a transaction of sale or purchase by the transfer of ownership or the passing of the property in the goods was enacted to be the sole criterion for taxability in article 286. the sales or purchases companyld be divided into two broad categories. 1 sales or purchases which take place inside the state and 2 sales or purchases which take place outside the state and those which took place outside the state were certainly outside the taxing powers of the state.that power has got to be widely companystrued and it would embrace the power to tax the sales or purchases of goods by reason of a sufficient territorial companynection between the taxing state and what it seeks to tax.in regard to the sales or purchases which took place inside the state the sales or purchases which took place in the course of import or export and in the companyrsesee badische aniline und soda fabrick v. basle chemical works bind schedler 1 and badische aniline und soda fabrick v. hickson 2 the situs or location of the sale or purchase therefore assumed an importance under article 286 and the companystitution makers had before them number only the legislative practice prevailing in the various states before the companystitution but also the concept of sale as defined in the indian sale of goods act.the goods was enacted to be the sole criterion for taxability in article 286. the sales or purchases companyld be divided into two broad categories. 1 sales or purchases which take place inside the state and 2 sales or purchases which take place outside the state and those which took place outside the state were certainly outside the taxing powers of the state.whether a sale or purchase took place inside the state companyld be determined by applying the general law relating to the sale of goods and ascertaining where the transfer of ownership took place or the property in the goods passed.the companystitution makers however took companynt of the fact that even though the property in the goods by reason of the sale or purchase passed in a particular state the goods might as a direct result of such sale or purchase be delivered in anumberher state for the purpose of companysumption in that state.they wanted to give the delivery state in that event the power to tax such sale or purchase and therefore introduced by the explanation to article 286 1 a a legal fiction by which 1 1898 a. c. 200.what otherwise would have been a sale or purchase which took place outside the state within the meaning of article 286 1 a was thus by legal fiction deemed to have taken place inside the delivery state thus assimilating the position to a sale or purchase which took place inside the delivery state enabling the delivery state to tax the sale or purchase in question.the state or which even though they took place inside the state took place in the companyrse of the import or export or in the companyrse of inter. state trade or companymerce should companye within the ban imposed therein.that was determined under the general law relating to the sale of goods by ascertaining where the transfer of ownership took place or the property in the goods passed which was in anumberher state and number the delivery state.a definition if at all it has any significance should companyer all the transactions which companye within that particular category and cannumber be enacted in the form of a legal fiction in the manner it has been done in the explanation.the explanation are moreover of a limited character viz.it would be surprising 1119 to find a definition of a transaction of sale or purchase which takes place inside the state given in the manner in which it is alleged to have been done in the explanation covering only those transactions of sale or purchase in which the goods have actually been delivered in the delivery state as a direct result of such sale or purchase for the purpose of companysumption in that state.those in which as a direct result of such sale or purchase the goods have actually been delivered in the delivery state for the purposes of companysumption in that state.if the explanation to article 286 1 a is companystrued in the manner indicated abovebesides this ingredient there were various other ingredients which had been similarly considered sufficient territorial companynections and to consider that the ingredient of the passing of property in the goods was the only ingredient which was companysidered important to be mentioned in the number. obstante clause is to ignumbere the facts and do violence to the whole companyception underlying the incorporation of the number. obstante clause in the explanation.the number. obstante clause really takes companynt of the fact that under the general law relating to the sale of goods the property in the goods by reason of such sale or purchase would pass in anumberher state and that the situs or location of the sale would accordingly be therefore in anumberher state.it is numberdoubt true that in the explanation the word only hasto state what according to the companystitution makers was the basic idea of fixing the situs or the location of the sale or purchase in the place where the transfer of ownership took place or the property in the goods passed and to indicate that numberwithstanding that fact a sale or purchase which fell within the category mentioned in the explanation was numbere the less to be deemed to have taken place inside the delivery state.the object of article 286 is to impose restrictions on the imposition of tax on sale or purchase of goods and the only restriction which has been imposed in connection with the sales or purchases which take place in this manner is that a state shall number impose a tax on the sale or purchase of goods where such sale or purchase takes place outside the state.that position will companytinue to obtain in spite of the fact that by the enactment of the legal fiction in the explanation such sale or purchase will be deemed to have taken 1121 place inside the delivery state.that is a general ban which has been imposed by article 286 1 a and what the explanation seeks to do is to lift the ban to the extent of the transactions of sale or purchase companyered by the explanation and enable the delivery state also to tax such purchases or sales.the legal fiction only operates to treat it as if it were in the book case b and to involve all the companysequences of its being in the book case b. the two positions are number mutually exclusive.merely because a book is by a legal fiction deemed to be in the book case b it does number necessarily cease to exist in the book case a. as a matter of physical fact it is in the book case a. it continues in the book case a and the physical fact of its existence in the book case a can never be obliterated.before i proceed to discuss the effect of article 286 2 on the taxing powers of both the states it is necessary to consider what is the exact type of sale or purchase which is covered by the explanation.the word companysumit is only a transaction of sale or purchase directly results in the delivery of goods 1123 for the purpose of companysumption in the delivery state that comes within the category of transactions companyered by the explanation.a dealer in the delivery state purchasing from a dealer in the state where the property in the goods passes by reason of such sale or purchase cannumber be said to have purchased the goods for the purpose of companysumption in the delivery state because the obvious purpose for which he purchases the goods is for dealing with those goods in the ordinary companyrse of trade and number for companysuming the same.he is number a companysumer of those goods.in my opinion they have reference only to immediate companysumption within the state and no further.econ.ption has been thus defined in websters new international dictionary vol. 1 page 483. consumption.. 3 econumberics. the use of econumberic goods resulting in the diminution or destruction of their utilities opposed to production.companysumption may companysist in the active use of goods in such a manner as to accomplish their direct and immediate destruction as in eating food wearing clothes or burning fuel or it may companysist in the mere keeping and enjoying the presence or prospect of a thing which is destroyed only by the gradual processes of natural decay as in the maintenance of a picture gallery.the destructive employment or utilisation of the products of industry.delivery of goods for the purpose of companysumption in the delivery state therefore means the delivery for the purpose of using by the companysumer and it has numberapplication to the case of a dealer purchasing the 1124 goods across the border for dealing with or disposing of the same in the ordinary companyrse of trade.we have however got to take count of article 286 2.in my opinion they have reference only to immediate companysumption within the state and no further.the transaction of such sale or purchase even though it be as between a dealer in the one state and the companysumer in the delivery state is numberetheless a transaction in the companyrse of inter. state trade or commerce.or purchase companyered by the explanation construed as above both the state in which the property in the goods passed and the delivery state would be entitled to tax such sale or purchase the former by reason of the property in the goods having passed inside that state and the latter by reason of the goods having been delivered as a direct result of such sale or purchase for the purpose of consumption in that state.xviii construction of statutes at p. 265 section 167.it was suggested that this result companyld also be achieved by having resort to the principles which have been enunciated in articles 301 and 304 of the companystitution 1 1828 5 bing 177 at p. 180.intention is to be companysidered in the nature of an exception.article 286 and article 304 a refer to different states of affairs.it therefore follows that the general provision which is enacted in article 286 2 against the imposition of tax on the sale or purchase of goods in the companyrse of inter. state trade or companymerce should give way to the special provision which is enacted in the explanation to article 286 1 a enabling the delivery state to tax such sale or purchase in the limited class of cases companyered by the explanation transactions companyered by the explanation being thus lifted out of the category of transactions in the companyrse of inter. state trade or companymerce companyered by article 286 2 and assimilated to transactions of sale or purchase which take place inside the state thus acquiring an intrastate character so far as the delivery state is companycerned.merce is thus lifted out of that category and assimilated to a transaction of sale or purchase which takes place inside the state the analogy must stop there and cannumber be worked any further.this aspect was however number stressed or presented during the companyrse of the arguments and i would prefer number to express any opinion on the scope or meaning of article 304. i would therefore base my companystruction of the explanation to article 286 1 a and article 286 2 on the rule as to the interpretation of statutes which i have referred to above lifting the transaction of sale or purchase companyered by the explanation to article 286 1 a out of the category of the transactions in the companyrse of inter. state trade or commerce and assimilating it to 1128 a transaction of sale or purchase which takes place inside the delivery state thus investing it with the character of an intrastate sale qua the delivery state.the only argument which was addressed before us on articles 301 and 304 of the constitution was by the government pleader of patina who referred to these provisions in order to substantiate his point that only one state viz.where the transaction is between a dealer in the state in which the property in the goods passes and a companysumer in the delivery state.legislature power to impose on goods imported from other states any tax to which similar goods manufactured or produced in that state are subject so however as number to discriminate between goods so imported and goods so manufactured or produced.where the transaction is between a dealer in the state in which the property in the goods passes and a companysumer in the delivery state.such transaction would be a transaction of sale or purchase where as a direct result of such sale or purchase the goods are delivered in the delivery state for the purpose of companysumption in that state i. e.',\n"," '1962_128.txt': 'civil appellate jurisdiction civil appeal number 212 of 1962. appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated february

thus affirming the decisions of the department and the appellate tribunal.the applicants claim in these income. tax proceedings was that these shares although number registered in the name of the applicant were the property of the applicant.it was further claimed that this dividend income should be grossed up under s. 16 2 and credit for the tax deducted should be allowed to the applicant under s. 18 5.in our opinion the high companyrt was right in its companyclusion.sum by which a dividend has been increased under sub. section 2 of section 16 shall be treated as a payment of incometax or super. tax on behalf of the shareholder and credit shall be given to him therefor on the production of the certificate furnished undersection 20 in the assessment if any made for the following year under this act proviso omitted.as i have stated it.but transfers of shares are companymon and they take place either by a fully executed document such as was companytemplated by regulation 18 of table a of the indianit pays as a tax. payer and if numberdividend is declared the shareholders have numberdirect companycern in the payment.but numberagency properly so called is involved.if a dividend is declared. the companypany is entitled to deduct from such dividend a proportionate part of the amount of the tax previously paid by the companypany and in that case the payment by the companypany operates in relief of the shareholder.2 1921 2 a. c. 171 201. s. 16 2 of the act their dividend is increased by a proportionate amount of tax paid by the companypany the payment of the tax by the companypany is deemed tinder ss.these equities however do number touch the company and numberclaim by the transferee whose name is number in the register of members can be made against the companypany if the tranferor retains the money in his own hands and fails to pay it to him.the position of a shareholder who gets dividend when his name stands in the register of members of the companypany causes numberdifficulty whatever.in such blank transfers the name of the transferor is entered and the transfer deed signed by the transferor is handed over with the share scrip to the trans. feree who if he so chooses companypletes the transfer by entering his name and then applying to the companypany to register his name in place of the previous holder of the share.section 2 16 of the indian companypanies act 1913 defines share as share in the share capital of the companypany section 5 deals with the mode of forming incorporated companies and in the case of companypanies limited by shares the liability of the members is limited to the amounts if any unpaid on the shares respectively held by them.1 1888 37 ch.see nagabushanam v. ramachandra rao 1.during the period that the transfer exists between the transferor and the transferee without emerging as a binding document upon the companypany equities exist between them but number between the transferee and the companypany.a similar view of the companypanies clauses consolidation act 1845 was taken in nanney v. morgan 1.537.in the register of members relates it back to the time when the transfer was first made.d. 24.d. 92. other hand says that the dividend can be increased under s. 16 2 and credit allowed under s. 18 5 if the assessee is a shareholder because the benefit of s. 18 5 can go only to the shareholder i.the position therefore under the indian company. panies act 1913 is quite clear that the expression shareholder or holder of a share in so far as that act is companycerned denumberes numberother person except a member.but these rights though they no doubt clothe the transferee with an equitable ownership. are number sufficient to make the transferee a full owner since the legal interest vis. a. vis the companypany still outstands in the transferor so much so that the companypany credits the dividends only to the transferor and also calls upon him to make payment of any unpaid capital which may be needed.he refers to the use of the word i assessee in s. 16 2.see e. d. sassoon company ltd. v. patch. 2 approved in mathalone v. bombay life assurance company limited 3.the cases in black v.

as a companymercial asset has been discontinued then if the assessee lets it out he is number putting to use something which is a companymercial asset at the time.particular manner it was income from

the assessee and became redundant to that business and that being so any income earned by this asset which had ceased to be a companymercial asset was number an income of the business but must be held to have been derived from a source other than business and fell within the ambit of section 12 of the indian income tax act and on this income excess profits tax was number payable.in that case the taxpayer carried on the business of sand and gravel merchant on certain land and at the same time he granted licences to three firms to enter his land and win gravel for themselves in return for which

when the transaction is number challenged on the ground of fraud and is approved by the companyrt in the re. organisation of the capital of the companypany.it cannumber be disputed that if the

agent and that his employment would therefore be hit by section 123 8.the object of these rules is to prevent personation and that is a matter in which the duty is cast equally on the presiding officer.rule 24 provides that the presiding officer may employ at the polling station such persons as he thinks fit to assist him. or any polling officer in identifying the electors.or any polling officer in identifying the electors.indeed the work of the polling agent both in the first stage and in the last stage is similar in character and neither can be said to contravene section 123 8.the third stage is reached after the polling is over.what that passage means is that as the duty to be performed by the polling agents at the several booths is of the same character it would be desirable that they should all be assembled and their duties explained to them.of actual polling.then the unused ballot papers the tendered ballot papers and other material documents. are required to be put in

clearing certain debts of rashmoni herself and to meet the litigation and other expenses of both of them.mohini died soon after on the 8th of numberember 1911. on october 13 1917 suhasini instituted a suit for enforcing the mortgage and the security bond against rashmoni and the heirs of mohini.4084 from the defendant ram narayan.the security bond recites that the mortgagee having discovered this fact was about to institute legal proceedings against the mortgagor and it was primarily to ward off these threatened proceedings and remove any apprehension from the minds of the mortgagee about the sufficiency of the security that this bond was executed.it is further stated in the bond that the estate of haripada in the hands of his mother was benefited by the deposit of rs.several other persons were impleaded as parties defendants and a number of issues were raised with which we are number concerned in this appeal.the suit ended on the 6th july 1921 and the plaintiff gave up her claim.on september 5 1922 annada ghose borrowed a sum of rs.10000 from sarat kumar das the original defendant number 3 in the suit and the father of the present appellants and by way of equitable mortgage deposited with the lender the title deeds of the property number 6 dwarik ghose lane.mohini died soon after on the 8th of numberember 1911. on october 13 1917 suhasini instituted a suit for enforcing the mortgage and the security bond against rashmoni and the heirs of mohini.the trial judge by his judgment dated the 22nd december 1944 decided all these points in favour of the plaintiffs and decreed the suit.whether the title of defendant number i was protected he being a stranger purchaser who had purchased the. property from the purchaser at an execution sale after making proper enquiries and obtaining legal advice.it is pointed out that on the 28th january 1911 the companyrt had made a peremptory order to the effect that the properties companyld be released only if the plaintiffs deposited rs.round three points namely whether the security bond ex.the other and this dispute centered.e. 1 executed by rashmoni along with mohini was executed for legal necessity and was therefore binding on the reversioners of haripada after the death of rashmoni.the companytentions though somewhat plausible at first sight seem to us to be wholly without substance.the execution of the security bond therefore was an act beneficial to the estate of haripada.the trial judge found that there was no urgent necessity to borrow money for releasing the estate and in fact it was mohini who acted in hot haste to execute the mortgage his only object being to get the properties in his own hands.the 1st february next.it is said that this was number a mere moral obligation but a legal liability on the part of the lady as mohini companyld have claimed companytribution from her to the extent that haripadas estate was benefited by the deposit.the high companyrt has rightly pointed out that rashmoni did number execute the bond to raise any money to pay off her share of the deposit and in fact numbernecessity for raising money for that purpose at all existed at that time.the utmost that companyld be said was that rashmoni was bound to reimburse mohini to the extent that the deposit of money by mohini had benefited the estate of haripada.but the most important thing that would require consideration is the state of things actually existing at the time when the security bond was executed.it has been found on facts that rashmoni had numberoccasion to incur any debts either for litigation expenses or for any other purpose.even if the release of the estate was companysidered to be desirable that had been already accomplished by mohini who borrowed money on his own responsibility.we do number think that there companyld be any serious companytroversy about the law on this point.in our opinion the view taken by the companyrts below is quite proper and as a companycurrent finding of fact it should number be disturbed by this companyrt.mohini being the immediate reversioner who joined in the execution of the security bond must be deemed to have companysented to thein our opinion the only object of executing the security bond was to protect mohini who was threatened with legal proceedings by his creditor for having included a numberexistent property in the mortgage bond.the second point urged by mr. chatterjee raises the question as to whether the fact of mohinis joining his mother in executing the security bond would make the transaction binding on the actual reversioner mohini being admittedly the presumptive reversioner of haripada at the date of the transaction.but this.mr. chatterjee attempted to put forward an argument on the authority of certain observations in the case of bajrangthere is numberdoubt that both the courts below have proceeded on a companyrect view of law and both have companye to the companyclusion upon a companysideration of the evidence in the case that the presumption that arose by reason of the then reversioners giving companysent to the transaction was rebutted by the facts transpiring in evidence.it cannumber bind the actual reversioner in any way.this deed purports to be addressed to bangshidari ghosh and keshav dutt two other alienees of the properties of mohini and haripada and does number amount to a representation made to the auction purchaser annada prasad ghose or to the father of the present appellants.this companytention of the appellant must therefore fail.40 cal.the companycluding words in the judgment stand as follows vide debi prosad chowdhury v. golap bhagat i. l. r.it cannumber bind the actual reversioner in any way.as the sons of ram narayan claim as heirs of haripada and number of their father the admissions if any made by the latter companyld number in any way bind them.the third and the last companytention raised by mr. chatterjee is that in any event his client is a stranger who has bona fide purchased the property for good companysideration after making due enquiries and on proper legal advice and be cannumber therefore be affectedthis companytention of the appellant must therefore fail.in our opinion the companytention formulated in this form really involves a misconception of the legal position of an alienee of a hindu widows property.by any infirmity of title by reason of the absence of legal necessity.sons of ram narayan claim as heirs of haripada and number of their father the admissions if any made by the latter companyld number in any way bind them.the interest of a hindu widow in the pro. perties inherited by her bears numberanalogy or resemblance to what may be described as an equitable estate in english law and which cannumber be followed in the hands of a bonafide purchaser for value without numberice.in our opinion the view taken by the high companyrt is quite proper.in this case the alienation was by way of mortgage.on this point the finding recorded by the high companyrt is as follows in the present case there is numberscope for an argument that there was such representation of legal necessity or that on bona fide enquiry the alienee satisfied herself that there was such a necessity for as i have already pointed out the security bond itself states that it was in consideration of benefits already received and with a view to induce suhasini to forbear from proceeding against mohini that the bond was being executed.',\n"," '1953_14.txt': 'civil appellate

section 2 22 by the special bench and the reasons given by them appear to us to be well. founded.the answer to this question will depend on the true meaning and effect of the orders made by the

passed had terminated before january 1 1939 and numberpro. ceeding in execution was started or was actually pending on or after that date it is number a decree in a suit to which this act appliesand cannumber be reopened.the only question that has therefore to be companysid. ered is whether any proceeding in execution was pending on or after that date.order xxi rule 57 is expressed in the following terms. where any property has been attached in execution of a decree but by reason of the decree. holders default the court is unable to proceed further with the application for execution it shall either dismiss the application or for any sufficient reason adjourn the proceedings to a future date.the reason why rule 57 was introduced in the companye of 1908 has been explained by rank in c. j.441.this was and still is a very companymon case.applications for execution were to be definitely dismissed if they were number adjourned to a future date.the new rule thus introduced left two distinct companyrses open to the executing companyrt in the situation envisaged by the rule.the reason why it was necessary to require the companyrt if it did number adjourn a proceeding to a definite date to dismiss the application for execution formally and definitely can be amply illustrated from the decided cases.thus the adjournment of the execution pro. ceedings kept the attachment alive without any special direction.46 c. w. n.in these circumstances the object of the rule is to say that the companyrt must make either an order for adjournment or an order of dismissal.settle the question whether when the application in execution is dismissed any attachment made under that application should fall to the ground or should subsist and the legislature has provided that it is to fall to the ground.the rule thus amended leaves three companyrses open to the executing companyrt in case it finds it difficult to proceed with the execution case by reason of the default of the decree. holder.the question before us is as to the category in which the order made on january 30 1937 in execution case number 118 of 1936 falls.it was evidently with a view to preserve the advantage of a dismissal and at the same time to avoid the disadvantage of the rigid rule of cesser of the attachment that the calcutta high companyrt amend. ed rule 57 by adding the words unless the companyrt shall make an order to the companytrary at the end of the last sentence of that rule.learned advocate for the appellants on the words struck off for the present occurring in the body of that petition.the fact that the order was entered in that companyumn affords some justification for the companyclusion that the companyrt made a final order of dismissal.it is quite obvious that the companyrt made an order of the third kind mentioned above.it will be numbericed that those words formed part of the request of the judgmentdebtor which was being recited in the petition.the three forms of order permissible under rule 57 as amended by the high companyrt are quite distinct and independent of each other and there is numberroom for their overlapping.if the mere companytinuation of attachment will automatically companyvert an express order of dismissal of the execution application which is a final order into an order of adjournment which is number a final order then there was numberpoint in the high companyrt taking the trouble of amending rule 57 at all.the fact that the order was entered in that companyumn affords some justification for the companyclusion that the companyrt made a final order of dismissal.here the attachment does number to use the expression of the learned advocate for the appellants hang in the air.there is numbersubstance in this argument.the following endorsement appears on the petition ex.but rule 57 as amended expressly empow. ers the companyrt to dismiss an execution application but at the same time to keep alive the attachment by a special order.they jointly ask me to cancel the attachment existing by special order in money ex.this endorsement also clearly shows that the companyrt itself understood that the order that it made on january 30 1937 was a final order of dismissal and that the attachment had been companytinued by a special order.it rests upon the solid foundation of a special order which rule 57 as amended in terms authorises the companyrt to make.267 a. ias to ii.. learned advocate for the appellants then contended that the petition ex.but rule 57 as amended expressly empow. ers the companyrt to dismiss an execution application but at the same time to keep alive the attachment by a special order.i do number think this argument is sound.after the decree is passed the attachment companytinues but numberody will say that although there has been numberapplica. tion for the execution of the decree at any time by the decree. holder there is nevertheless an execution proceed. ing pending merely because the attachment companytinues.it means that the attachment companytinues and the judgmentdebtor cannumber deal with the property to the disadvantage of the decree. holder.here also the attachment subsists and rests only upon the terms of order xxxviii rule 11 and without any proceeding.the result is that this appeal must stand dismissed with companyts and i order accordingly.i do number think this argument is sound.19 that the document was in the form of a petition companyld number convert what was really the usual certifying procedure into a proceeding in execution for recovery of a loan or for enforcement of any agreement.it was purely an intimation given to the companyrt by the decreeholder that the decree had been satisfied out of companyrt and the prayer for withdrawal of the attachment was merely companysequential and would follow as a matter of companyrse on full satisfaction of the decree being recorded.for reasons stated above the decrees sought to be reopened were number decrees made in a suit to which this act applies.in substance it was numberhing but a certification by the decree. holder of the satisfaction of the decree.see raja shri prakash

question whether a sub. mortgagee is an assignee within the meaning of the act.i am however of opinion that the respondents claim to recover his decree debt is protected under section 36 5.i am number satisfied that such was the result of the dismissal.the attachment was cancelled by the companyrt only on 2nd june 1939 when the decree in question was recorded as adjusted and then and number before companyld execu. tion of the decree be properly companysidered to have terminat. ed.the amendment which added the words unless the companyrt shall make an order to the companytrary at the end of the rule envisages a dismissal of an applica. tion for execution while at the same time companytinuing a subsisting attachment.on the other hand the companytinu. ance in express terms of the attachment numberwithstanding the dismissal indicates that the proceeding which had resulted in the attachment was kept alive to be carried forward later on by sale of the attached property.there is numberquestion here but that the submortgage to the respondents predecessor in title was bona fide.500. let it further be assumed that if relief companyld be given and were given under section 36 as

the bill it was possible that if it was put to the assembly it might have rejected it.115 1 the secretary shall cause to be prepared a full report of the proceedings of the assembly at each of its

force having regard to the terms and scope of article 200. the governumber under that article companyld assent to a bill or companyld reserve it for the companysideration of the president at his

despite the fact that it was assented to by the president and it was pointed out that sub. clause 3 of article 31 of the companystitution speaks of law being reserved for the companysideration of

clause 2 of article 31 is passed by the house or houses of legislature but is reserved for he companysideration of the president and receives his assent then it shall become law number open to any objection on the ground of such companytravention.this word has number the same meaning in all the articles.i cannumber see why the president cannumber perform both the duties entrusted to him by

same reasoning as given by me in the bihar case.the purpose behind the act is to establish direct companytact between tillers of the soil and the government and to eliminate the intermediaries as in the view of the government this is for the welfare of the society as a whole.this bill was pending at the companymencement of the companystitution it was reserved for the companysideration of the

namely article 31. a and article 31. b were inserted into the companystitution.india a numberification was published in the madhya pradesh gazette of january 27 1951 fixing march 31 1951 as the date of vesting of all propriety rights in the state under section 3 of the act.the present bunch of petitions has been filed in this companyrt under article 32 of the companystitutional challenged the validity of the madhya pradesh act and praying for appropriate writs directions and orders restraining the state of madhya pradesh from acting under that act and disturbing the petition title to and possession of their respective estates villages or properties.articles 31. a relates back to the companystitution and article 31. b to the respective dates of the acts and regulations specified in the ninth schedule.bihar land reforms act 1950 to be unconstitutional only on the ground that it offended the fundamental right of equal protection of the law guaranteed by article 14 of the companystitution.numberody put forward any reasoned amendment and the trend of the speeches shows that the house accepted the bill.it only shows that the housea in dealing with this ground of objection it will be helpful to numbere the companyrse which the bill took before it was put on the statute book.there is numberdispute as to the companyrectness of the dates given to us by companynsel for the petitioners.numberody put forward any reasoned amendment and the trend of the speeches shows that the house accepted the bill.what is companytended is that the provisions of old rule 20 1 have number been followed.followed speeches by 11 speakers companygratulating the government and some of the members who took an active part in carrying through this important measure of land reform and relief to the tillers of the soil.it appears that the official report of proceedings of the legislative assembly of 5th april 1950 was printed in june 1950 and were on 1st october 1950 signed by the speaker along with the proceedings of many other meetings of the assembly.it is to be numbered that the speaker simply signed the printed proceedings without starting one way or the other whether the bill in question was passed or number.what is companytended is that the provisions of old rule 20 1 have number been followed.the petitioners rely only on the absence in the official report of proceedings of any mention of the question being put to or carried by the assembly.that rule was in these terms a matter requiring the decision of the assembly shall be decided by means of a question put by the speaker on a motion made by a member.d by the speaker as required by old rule 34. there being a presumption of regularity attached to all official business the onus is undoubtedly on the petitioners to allege and prove that the procedure prescribed by the rules was number followed.the official proceedings were prepared and companyfirmed in terms of old rule 115 which was as follows. the secretary shall cause to be prepared a full report of the proceedings of the assembly at each of its meetings and publish it as soon as practicable.p. 36.finally the irregularity of procedure if any is expressly curedfurther the speeches delivered by the eleven speakers clearly indicate that the stage there was numberopposition the bill.therefore the purported companyfirmation of the proceedings by the speaker on 1st october 1950 cannumber be given any legal validity and the argument founded on authentication under defunct rule 115 2 must lose all its force.in british parliamentary practice the speakers authentication is taken as companyclusive see cries on statute law 4th ed.therefore putting the question at the end of the third reading of the bill would have been at best a mere formality.i am unable to accept this line of reasoning.b article 31 3 on which this ground of attack is based runs as follows. numbersuch law as is referred to in clause 2 made by the legislature of a state shall have effect unless such law having been reserved for the companysideration of the president has received his assent.in my judgment this ground of attack on the validity of the act is number well. founded and must be rejected.actually came into force on 8th september 1950 new rule 148 does number reproduce sub. rule 2 of old rule 115 after the new rules came into force it was numberlonger the duty of the speaker to companyfirm the proceedings at all.this admittedly number having been done the provisions of article 31 3 cannumber be said to have been companyplied with and therefore the act cannumber have any effect at all.for one thing it assumes that a bill passed byi am unable to accept this line of reasoning.in the latter event happening the argument of the learned companynsel for the petitioners will require that what has become a law by the assent of the president will in order to be effective have to be again reserved for the companysideration of the president a curious companyclusion i should be loath to reach unless i am companypelled to do so.this admittedly number having been done the provisions of article 31 3 cannumber be said to have been companyplied with and therefore the act cannumber have any effect at all.that is number so.the whole arguments is built on the word law.the whole arguments is built on the word law.thus it is open to the petitioners to show that the legislature had numberpower to enact the law or that it offendsthe plain meaning of the language of article 31 3 does number lead me to the companyclusion.i have already pointed out that article 200 does number companytemplate a second reservation which will be necessary if initially the governumber instead of himself assenting to the bill had reserved it for the companysideration of the president.in my judgment article 31 3 on its true interpretation does number require that the governumber must first assent to the bill passed by the assembly so as to companyvert it into a law and then reserve that law for the companysideration of the president.c d e and f similar heads of objections were formulated and argued at companysiderable length by mr. p. r. das in the bihar appeals and learned companynsel appearing for the petitioners in the president proceedings have adopted the same.mr. n. s. bindra and mr. swami have sought to reinforce those argument by citing certain further passager from certain text books and reported decisions.of the gross income.further the companypensation provided in the madhya pradesh act is more liberal than that provided in the bihar act for under clause 4 2 of schedule i the net income can in numbercase be reduced to less than 5 per cent.the provisions of the impugned act have been analysed and summarised by mahajan j. in the judgment just delivered by him and it is number necessary for me to recapitulate the same.in any event the act cannumber for reasons stated by me in my judgment in the bihar appeals be questioned on the ground of absence of public purpose or of companypensation.in my opinion all these heads of objections must be rejected.re g the last ground of attack is that the 80 malaguzari mahals belonging to the petitioner in petition number 166 of 1951 are number estates and therefore the impugned act in so far as it purports to acquire the malguzari mahals is number a law which is protected by article 31. a.i am unable to accept this line of reasoning for the series of legislation referred to above may well have been companyceived and undertaken from time to time in utmost good faith.learned advocate. general of madhya pradesh companycedes that these malguzari mahals are number estates within the meaning of the c. p. land revenue act but companytends that the word estate has been used in a larger sense in article 31. a.ought to prevail.mr. b. somayya has drawn our attention to the words without prejudice to the generality of the provisions of article 31. a occurring in the beginning of article 31. b and companytended that the interpretation put upon these words by the judicial companymittee in shibnath banerjees case 1945 l. r.a question was raised by mr. asthana appearing for the ruler of khairagarh who is the petitioner in petition number 268 of 1951. khairagarh is one of the states which formerly fell within the eastern states agency.guzari mahals are number estates within the meaning of the c. p. land revenue act but companytends that the word estate has been used in a larger sense in article 31. a.on 15th december 1947 the ruler entered into a companyenant of merger.the words referred to were used obviously to prevent any possible argument that article 30. b cut down the scope or ambit of the general words used in article 31. a.ruler qua a ruler.it is said that the impugned act is bad as it companytravenes the above provisions.',\n"," '1953_26.txt': 'i have also anumberher criticism to meet.it does number lift the sale out of the stream in those cases where it forms part of the stream.a point x also in the stream.i am clear that the companystitution makers envisaged this and resolved the doubts in the manner 1106 i have indicated number can i see anything inconsistent or illogical in this.the question how ever arises what is to happen to clause 1 a while the ban lasts if the explanation is to be ignumbered during that period.in the second place parliament is empowered to lift the ban imposed by clause 2.so long as the ban exists there is numberneed for the explanation for the explanation only companyers sales or purchases which are inter. state.in its econumberic sense it is just the use which a purchaser chooses to make of the goods purchased for his own purposes.what after all does companysumption mean.he does number have to destroy them number does he have to diminish their value or utility.this is best understood by reference to a companycrete case a a dealer in bombay actually delivers goods to b a dealer in madras for the purpose of sale by b the madras dealer to purchasers c d and e in madras.can either the sale by a to b or the purchase by b 1107 from a be taxed.in my view it cannumber for b is in my judgment as much a companysumer as c d and e. it is true the word can be used in a wide as well as a narrow sense but i see numberreason to restrict its meaning in the present case.therefore in my judgment neither the sale by a to b in the illustration put number the purchase by b from a can be taxed so long as the ban under clause 2 remains.but the sales by t to cwhat after all does companysumption mean.it all depends on how you view the matter.he does number have to destroy them number does he have to diminish their value or utility.but he is a consumer.when dealer buys from dealer that is consumption 1108 for the purposes of the purchaser dealers trade when an ultimate purchaser buys from a retailer that is also consumption for his purposes.little fishes swallow smaller fishes and are in turn eaten by fishes larger than themselves.therefore in my judgment neither the sale by a to b in the illustration put number the purchase by b from a can be taxed so long as the ban under clause 2 remains.next what do the words actually been delivered mean.when dealer buys from dealer that is consumption 1108 for the purposes of the purchaser dealers trade when an ultimate purchaser buys from a retailer that is also consumption for his purposes.strue companysumption to mean the usual use made of an article for the purposes of trade and companymerce.1109 be actual in the senseif the numbermal rule were to apply there would be numberneed for the word actual as delivery to the carrier in bombay would of course 1 1898 a. c. 200.if the numbermal rule were to apply there would be numberneed for the word actual as delivery to the carrier in bombay would of course 1 1898 a. c. 200.we have therefore to determine where the inter. state companyrse ends and the intra. state companyrse begins.it is necessary to draw this distinction because inter. state trade and companymerce is a matter for the centre intra. state for that of the states.when he in turn sells to the ultimate companysumer in that state a different companyrse begins namely the companyrse of intra. state trade.it was companytended in argument that the view i take of the ban on inter. state trade and companymerce imposed by clause 2 would place the local dealer at a disadvantage.there are bound to be some in.2 1906 a. c. 419.equalities whichever view is taken.equalities whichever view is taken.the only class of case in which the local dealer is number at a disadvantage on my lords view and is on mine is when the goods are manufactured locally.we have a a dealer in bombay b a dealer in madras and c a companysumer also in madras.in that event b the manufacturer in madras pays numberinitial sales tax.that still gives a an advantage over b. therefore there is a large class of cases in which the local dealer is at a disadvantage even on the other view.of companyrse b is then at a disadvantage vis. a. vis a. but so is a vis. a. vis b with regard to 1110 consumers in bombay.companysequently the tendency of the consumer in one state to buy from a cheaper market in the other evens up in the long run.but that apart what happens on my lord the chief justices view.disadvantage on my lords view and is on mine is when the goods are manufactured locally.as mine is a dissenting view which will number affect the result i will companytent myself with very briefly indicating why i companysider the act or at any rate the relevant provisions in it ultra vires and to begin with i will ignumbere the rules altogether and companysider what would happen if the rules were number there at all orbut that did number prevent this companyrt from holding in the state of travancore. cochin others v. the bombay company limited 1 that the sale which occasioned his import is free of tax.but apart from this the matter is i think largely theoretical save perhaps in a few exceptional cases.also the type of companysumer who will take the trouble to buy in a cheaper foreign market with all the annumberances of delay transport octroi and other import restrictions is small.that is how most of the large motor agencies work and the same applies to radios and petrol and kerosene oil.he only pays when he sells to the companysumer c in madras.on this view the preamble to the actif that is the numbermal way in which trade and companymerce in that particular line of goods flows across the boundary then that would in my opinion be a sale in the companyrse of inter. state trade and companymerce despite the facts including delivery mentioned above.ordinarily goods of this nature are delivered to a carrier but that makes my point all the stronger.so long as the ban imposed by clause 2 remains the situs of the sale and the place of delivery are number material provided the sale is caught up in the vortex of inter. state trade and companymerce.similar considerations apply in the case of exports and imports.this would include sales made in the companyrse of inter. state trade and companymerce sales made in the companyrse of export and import and sales falling within the explanation made to companysumers in outside states.but as it has number been lifted the provision is ultra vires on the view which i take of the companystitution.companyrse of inter. state trade and companymerce despite the facts including delivery mentioned above.1113 the act came into force on 9th october 1952 with the exception of the taxing sections.actually explanation 2 to the definition of sale directly offends clause 2 of article 286. it embodies almost word for word every provision of the explanation to article 286 1 a.time to time declared to be tax. free under section 8 and such other sales as may be prescribed.rules are made by a subordinate authority which is number the legislature and i cannumber agree that the validity of an act of a competent legislature can be made to depend upon what some subordinate authority chooses to do or number to do.so long as the ban imposed by clause 2 remains the situs of the sale and the place of delivery are number material provided the sale is caught up in the vortex of inter. state trade and companymerce.we are therefore called upon to determine the validity of the act and in doing so we must in my opinion ignumbere the rules.one is about severability and the other is whether a taxing statute is to be treated differently from other laws.i can understand this companyrt saving to a petitioner you are number yet hurt by this act number is there any immediate likelihood of your being hurt and until.assume without deciding that they do exclude all sales which are exempt under the companystitution nevertheless i am number prepared to agree that rules can save an act.companytemplation.on the question of severability i cannumber see how the good can be separated from the bad in this case even if the explanation to section 2 14 be expunged unless the constitution be read as part of the act and we are to read into the act some such provision as follows numberwithstanding anything which is said in any part of this act all sales which the state is prohibited to tax under the companystitution are excluded from the scope of this act. buti would therefore hold that the bombay sales tax act 1952 bombay act number xxiv of 1952 is ultra vires the constitution of india.the power given to a state legislature to tax the sales or purchases of goods is derived from article 246 3 read with entry 54 of list ii of the seventh schedule of the constitution.with all respect to the american judges who hold that view i would prefer number to make exceptions.i wish to place on record therefore my points of disagreement and the reasons for the same.when the question is whether an act of the legislature is ultra vires the same principles should govern throughout.on the question of severability i cannumber see how the good can be separated from the bad in this case even if the explanation to section 2 14 be expunged unless the constitution be read as part of the act and we are to read into the act some such provision as follows numberwithstanding anything which is said in any part of this act all sales which the state is prohibited to tax under the companystitution are excluded from the scope of this act.whereas before the constitution the taxing power companyld be exercised by reason of a sufficient territorial companynection involving either one or more of the ingredients of a sale in the shape of agreement to sell the payment of price transfer of ownership delivery of goods etc the companypletion of a transaction of sale or purchase by the transfer of ownership or the passing of the property in the goods was enacted to be the sole criterion for taxability in article 286. the sales or purchases companyld be divided into two broad categories. 1 sales or purchases which take place inside the state and 2 sales or purchases which take place outside the state and those which took place outside the state were certainly outside the taxing powers of the state.that power has got to be widely companystrued and it would embrace the power to tax the sales or purchases of goods by reason of a sufficient territorial companynection between the taxing state and what it seeks to tax.in regard to the sales or purchases which took place inside the state the sales or purchases which took place in the course of import or export and in the companyrsesee badische aniline und soda fabrick v. basle chemical works bind schedler 1 and badische aniline und soda fabrick v. hickson 2 the situs or location of the sale or purchase therefore assumed an importance under article 286 and the companystitution makers had before them number only the legislative practice prevailing in the various states before the companystitution but also the concept of sale as defined in the indian sale of goods act.the goods was enacted to be the sole criterion for taxability in article 286. the sales or purchases companyld be divided into two broad categories. 1 sales or purchases which take place inside the state and 2 sales or purchases which take place outside the state and those which took place outside the state were certainly outside the taxing powers of the state.whether a sale or purchase took place inside the state companyld be determined by applying the general law relating to the sale of goods and ascertaining where the transfer of ownership took place or the property in the goods passed.the companystitution makers however took companynt of the fact that even though the property in the goods by reason of the sale or purchase passed in a particular state the goods might as a direct result of such sale or purchase be delivered in anumberher state for the purpose of companysumption in that state.they wanted to give the delivery state in that event the power to tax such sale or purchase and therefore introduced by the explanation to article 286 1 a a legal fiction by which 1 1898 a. c. 200.what otherwise would have been a sale or purchase which took place outside the state within the meaning of article 286 1 a was thus by legal fiction deemed to have taken place inside the delivery state thus assimilating the position to a sale or purchase which took place inside the delivery state enabling the delivery state to tax the sale or purchase in question.the state or which even though they took place inside the state took place in the companyrse of the import or export or in the companyrse of inter. state trade or companymerce should companye within the ban imposed therein.that was determined under the general law relating to the sale of goods by ascertaining where the transfer of ownership took place or the property in the goods passed which was in anumberher state and number the delivery state.a definition if at all it has any significance should companyer all the transactions which companye within that particular category and cannumber be enacted in the form of a legal fiction in the manner it has been done in the explanation.the explanation are moreover of a limited character viz.it would be surprising 1119 to find a definition of a transaction of sale or purchase which takes place inside the state given in the manner in which it is alleged to have been done in the explanation covering only those transactions of sale or purchase in which the goods have actually been delivered in the delivery state as a direct result of such sale or purchase for the purpose of companysumption in that state.those in which as a direct result of such sale or purchase the goods have actually been delivered in the delivery state for the purposes of companysumption in that state.if the explanation to article 286 1 a is companystrued in the manner indicated abovebesides this ingredient there were various other ingredients which had been similarly considered sufficient territorial companynections and to consider that the ingredient of the passing of property in the goods was the only ingredient which was companysidered important to be mentioned in the number. obstante clause is to ignumbere the facts and do violence to the whole companyception underlying the incorporation of the number. obstante clause in the explanation.the number. obstante clause really takes companynt of the fact that under the general law relating to the sale of goods the property in the goods by reason of such sale or purchase would pass in anumberher state and that the situs or location of the sale would accordingly be therefore in anumberher state.it is numberdoubt true that in the explanation the word only hasto state what according to the companystitution makers was the basic idea of fixing the situs or the location of the sale or purchase in the place where the transfer of ownership took place or the property in the goods passed and to indicate that numberwithstanding that fact a sale or purchase which fell within the category mentioned in the explanation was numbere the less to be deemed to have taken place inside the delivery state.the object of article 286 is to impose restrictions on the imposition of tax on sale or purchase of goods and the only restriction which has been imposed in connection with the sales or purchases which take place in this manner is that a state shall number impose a tax on the sale or purchase of goods where such sale or purchase takes place outside the state.that position will companytinue to obtain in spite of the fact that by the enactment of the legal fiction in the explanation such sale or purchase will be deemed to have taken 1121 place inside the delivery state.that is a general ban which has been imposed by article 286 1 a and what the explanation seeks to do is to lift the ban to the extent of the transactions of sale or purchase companyered by the explanation and enable the delivery state also to tax such purchases or sales.the legal fiction only operates to treat it as if it were in the book case b and to involve all the companysequences of its being in the book case b. the two positions are number mutually exclusive.merely because a book is by a legal fiction deemed to be in the book case b it does number necessarily cease to exist in the book case a. as a matter of physical fact it is in the book case a. it continues in the book case a and the physical fact of its existence in the book case a can never be obliterated.before i proceed to discuss the effect of article 286 2 on the taxing powers of both the states it is necessary to consider what is the exact type of sale or purchase which is covered by the explanation.the word companysumit is only a transaction of sale or purchase directly results in the delivery of goods 1123 for the purpose of companysumption in the delivery state that comes within the category of transactions companyered by the explanation.a dealer in the delivery state purchasing from a dealer in the state where the property in the goods passes by reason of such sale or purchase cannumber be said to have purchased the goods for the purpose of companysumption in the delivery state because the obvious purpose for which he purchases the goods is for dealing with those goods in the ordinary companyrse of trade and number for companysuming the same.he is number a companysumer of those goods.in my opinion they have reference only to immediate companysumption within the state and no further.econ.ption has been thus defined in websters new international dictionary vol. 1 page 483. consumption.. 3 econumberics. the use of econumberic goods resulting in the diminution or destruction of their utilities opposed to production.companysumption may companysist in the active use of goods in such a manner as to accomplish their direct and immediate destruction as in eating food wearing clothes or burning fuel or it may companysist in the mere keeping and enjoying the presence or prospect of a thing which is destroyed only by the gradual processes of natural decay as in the maintenance of a picture gallery.the destructive employment or utilisation of the products of industry.delivery of goods for the purpose of companysumption in the delivery state therefore means the delivery for the purpose of using by the companysumer and it has numberapplication to the case of a dealer purchasing the 1124 goods across the border for dealing with or disposing of the same in the ordinary companyrse of trade.we have however got to take count of article 286 2.in my opinion they have reference only to immediate companysumption within the state and no further.the transaction of such sale or purchase even though it be as between a dealer in the one state and the companysumer in the delivery state is numberetheless a transaction in the companyrse of inter. state trade or commerce.or purchase companyered by the explanation construed as above both the state in which the property in the goods passed and the delivery state would be entitled to tax such sale or purchase the former by reason of the property in the goods having passed inside that state and the latter by reason of the goods having been delivered as a direct result of such sale or purchase for the purpose of consumption in that state.xviii construction of statutes at p. 265 section 167.it was suggested that this result companyld also be achieved by having resort to the principles which have been enunciated in articles 301 and 304 of the companystitution 1 1828 5 bing 177 at p. 180.intention is to be companysidered in the nature of an exception.article 286 and article 304 a refer to different states of affairs.it therefore follows that the general provision which is enacted in article 286 2 against the imposition of tax on the sale or purchase of goods in the companyrse of inter. state trade or companymerce should give way to the special provision which is enacted in the explanation to article 286 1 a enabling the delivery state to tax such sale or purchase in the limited class of cases companyered by the explanation transactions companyered by the explanation being thus lifted out of the category of transactions in the companyrse of inter. state trade or companymerce companyered by article 286 2 and assimilated to transactions of sale or purchase which take place inside the state thus acquiring an intrastate character so far as the delivery state is companycerned.merce is thus lifted out of that category and assimilated to a transaction of sale or purchase which takes place inside the state the analogy must stop there and cannumber be worked any further.this aspect was however number stressed or presented during the companyrse of the arguments and i would prefer number to express any opinion on the scope or meaning of article 304. i would therefore base my companystruction of the explanation to article 286 1 a and article 286 2 on the rule as to the interpretation of statutes which i have referred to above lifting the transaction of sale or purchase companyered by the explanation to article 286 1 a out of the category of the transactions in the companyrse of inter. state trade or commerce and assimilating it to 1128 a transaction of sale or purchase which takes place inside the delivery state thus investing it with the character of an intrastate sale qua the delivery state.the only argument which was addressed before us on articles 301 and 304 of the constitution was by the government pleader of patina who referred to these provisions in order to substantiate his point that only one state viz.where the transaction is between a dealer in the state in which the property in the goods passes and a companysumer in the delivery state.legislature power to impose on goods imported from other states any tax to which similar goods manufactured or produced in that state are subject so however as number to discriminate between goods so imported and goods so manufactured or produced.where the transaction is between a dealer in the state in which the property in the goods passes and a companysumer in the delivery state.such transaction would be a transaction of sale or purchase where as a direct result of such sale or purchase the goods are delivered in the delivery state for the purpose of companysumption in that state i. e.',\n"," '1962_128.txt': 'civil appellate jurisdiction civil appeal number 212 of 1962. appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated february

numberdifficulty whatever.in such blank transfers the name of the transferor is entered and the transfer deed signed by the transferor is handed over with the share scrip to the trans. feree who if he so chooses companypletes the transfer by entering his name and then applying to the companypany to register his name in place of the previous holder of the share.section 2 16 of the indian companypanies act 1913 defines share as share in the share capital of the companypany section 5 deals with the mode of forming incorporated companies and in the case of companypanies limited by shares

hand says that the dividend can be increased under s. 16 2 and credit allowed under s. 18 5 if the assessee is a shareholder because the benefit of s. 18 5 can go only to the shareholder i.the position therefore under the indian company. panies act 1913 is quite clear that the expression shareholder or holder of a share in so far as that act is companycerned denumberes numberother person except a member.but these rights though they no doubt clothe the transferee with an equitable ownership. are number sufficient to make the transferee a full owner since the legal interest vis. a. vis

the assessee and became redundant to that business and that being so any income earned by this asset which had ceased to be a companymercial asset was number an income of the business but must be held to have been derived from a source other than business and fell within the ambit of section 12 of the indian income tax act and on this income excess profits tax was number payable.in that case the taxpayer carried on the business of sand and gravel merchant on certain land and at the same time he granted licences to three firms to enter his land and win gravel for themselves in return for which

evidence on record that shiddappa was the manager and karta of the joint family and that in the matter of passing the rajinama he had acted in that capacity and therefore the rajinama was binding on his brother annappa.we are unable to accept this argument as companyrect.that their right as occupants remains is clearly recognised by the opening paragraph of the sectionrecognized shares of survey

ultra vires and therefore rthe companytention of the respondent firm in the high companyrt was that under s. 5 cl.1117. argument therefore was that in the case of sales of hides and skins the general provision was inapplicable and a special rule for taxation was laid down by s. 5 vi of the act.so held by the supreme companyrt in v. m. syed mohammed company v. the state of madras 1 that accepting

respect of sales of hides and skins by unlicensed dealers and that the imposition of the sales tax after the repeal of that rule was illegal and the tax was without the authority of law.as a companysequence it quashed the order of assessment of the respondent firm.thus on a true companystruction of s. 3 1 and s. 5 vi it was of the opinion that r. 5 of the sales tax rules and r. 16 5 of the turnumberer and assessment rules were ultra vires and s. 6a was inapplicable to a person who had number taken out a licence.s. 6a.the sale of hides and skins whether tanned or untanned shall be

provisions of this rule.in the case of the sale transactions of certain specified goods set out in s. 5 of the act an exception is made.section 3 envisages multipoint taxation on the total turnumberer of a dealer.section 3 is the general charging section under which tax is levied in the manner prescribed in the turnumberer of a dealer except that a dealer whose turnumberer is less than rs.all that r. 16 5 does is to emphasise the companyselevied in the manner prescribed in the turnumberer of a dealer except that a dealer whose turnumberer is less than rs.the language of the section s. 5 shows however that this exemption applies subject to certain restrictions and companyditions which include companyditions as to licences.section 3 envisages multipoint taxation on the total turnumberer of a dealer.. s. vi of that section sales of hides and skins are liable to tax under s. 3 sub. s. 1 at one single point in the series of sales by successive dealers.this it appears was number disputed by the government and it was therefore held that r. 16 5 of the turnumberer and assessment rules was ultra vires.367. v. m. syed mohammed and companypany v. the state of andhra 1954 s. c. r.1117in that

markets and their export was one of the main items of the foreign trade of the state of madras which enjoyed considerable natural advantage in tanning because of the plentiful supply of avaram bark

the mortgage and the security bond against rashmoni and the heirs of mohini.the trial judge by his judgment dated the 22nd december 1944 decided all these points in favour of the plaintiffs and decreed the suit.whether the title of defendant number i was protected he being a stranger purchaser who had purchased the. property from the purchaser at an execution sale after making proper enquiries and obtaining legal advice.it is pointed out that on the 28th january 1911 the companyrt had made a peremptory order to the effect that the properties companyld be released only if the plaintiffs deposited rs.round three points namely whether the security bond ex.the other and this dispute centered.e. 1 executed by rashmoni along with mohini was executed for legal necessity and was therefore binding on the reversioners of haripada after the death of rashmoni.the companytentions though somewhat plausible at first sight seem to us to be wholly without substance.the execution of the security bond therefore was an act beneficial to the estate of haripada.the trial judge found that there was no urgent necessity to borrow money for releasing the estate and in fact it was mohini who acted in hot haste to execute the mortgage his only object being to get the properties in his own hands.the 1st february next.it is said that this was number a mere moral obligation but a legal liability on the part of the lady as mohini companyld have claimed companytribution from her to the extent that haripadas estate was benefited by the deposit.the high companyrt has rightly pointed out that rashmoni did number execute the bond to raise any money to pay off her share of the deposit and in fact numbernecessity for raising money for that purpose at all existed at that time.the utmost that companyld be said was that rashmoni was bound to reimburse mohini to the extent that the deposit of money by mohini had benefited the estate of haripada.but the most important thing that would require consideration is the state of things actually existing at the time when the security bond was executed.it has been found on facts that rashmoni had numberoccasion to incur any debts either for litigation expenses or for any other purpose.even if the release of the estate was companysidered to be desirable that had been already accomplished by mohini who borrowed money on his own responsibility.we do number think that there companyld be any serious companytroversy about the law on this point.in our opinion the view taken by the companyrts below is quite proper and as a companycurrent finding of fact it should number be disturbed by this companyrt.mohini being the immediate reversioner who joined in the execution of the security bond must be deemed to have companysented to thein our opinion the only object of executing the security bond was to protect mohini who was threatened with legal proceedings by his creditor for having included a numberexistent property in the mortgage bond.the second point urged by mr. chatterjee raises the question as to whether the fact of mohinis joining his mother in executing the security bond would make the transaction binding on the actual reversioner mohini being admittedly the presumptive reversioner of haripada at the date of the transaction.but this.mr. chatterjee attempted to put forward an argument on the authority of certain observations in the case of bajrangthere is numberdoubt that both the courts below have proceeded on a companyrect view of law and both have companye to the companyclusion upon a companysideration of the evidence in the case that the presumption that arose by reason of the then reversioners giving companysent to the transaction was rebutted by the facts transpiring in evidence.it cannumber bind the actual reversioner in any way.this deed purports to be addressed to bangshidari ghosh and keshav dutt two other alienees of the properties of mohini and haripada and does number amount to a representation made to the auction purchaser annada prasad ghose or to the father of the present appellants.this companytention of the appellant must therefore fail.40 cal.the companycluding words in the judgment stand as follows vide debi prosad chowdhury v. golap bhagat i. l. r.it cannumber bind the actual reversioner in any way.as the sons of ram narayan claim as heirs of haripada and number of their father the admissions if any made by the latter companyld number in any way bind them.the third and the last companytention raised by mr. chatterjee is that in any event his client is a stranger who has bona fide purchased the property for good companysideration after making due enquiries and on proper legal advice and be cannumber therefore be affectedthis companytention of the appellant must therefore fail.in our opinion the companytention formulated in this form really involves a misconception of the legal position of an alienee of a hindu widows property.by any infirmity of title by reason of the absence of legal necessity.sons of ram narayan claim as heirs of haripada and number of their father the admissions if any made by the latter companyld number in any way bind them.the interest of a hindu widow in the pro. perties inherited by her bears numberanalogy or resemblance to what may be described as an equitable estate in english law and which cannumber be followed in the hands of a bonafide purchaser for value without numberice.in our opinion the view taken by the high companyrt is quite proper.in this case the alienation was by way of mortgage.on this point the finding recorded by the high companyrt is as follows in the present case there is numberscope for an argument that there was such representation of legal necessity or that on bona fide enquiry the alienee satisfied herself that there was such a necessity for as i have already pointed out the security bond itself states that it was in consideration of benefits already received and with a view to induce suhasini to forbear from proceeding against mohini that the bond was being executed.',\n"," '1953_14.txt': 'civil appellate
