appellate tribunal of india at calcutta in appeals nos.with pay as provided by the act.the decision of the management was varied to this extent.he. however. considered that the total deprivation of leave with pay ordered by the management was a severe punishment and on the assumption that he had power to scrutinize the exercise of the discretion by the management in awarding punishment. reduced the punishment by 50 per cent and held that the workers would be deprived of only half their holidays with pay.the adjudicator gave the award which was published in the gazette on 12th october. 1950.in view of this finding he upheld the view of the management that the continuity of service of the workers was broken by the interruption caused by the illegal strike and that as a consequence the workers who participated in such strike were not entitled to annual holidays with pay under section 49. b. 1. of the factories act..section 2 qwe have not been able to appreciate the view expressed by the appellate tribunal that stoppage of work for a period of two to four hours and such non. permitted absence from work cannot be regarded as strike.he further hold that the refusal of the workers to resume work in spite of the attempts made by the officers and their own madras labour union representatives indicated that they were not as a body prepared to resume work unless their demand was conceded.that being so. the action of the workers on the night of the 1st november clearly fell within the definition of the expression strike in section 2. q. of the industrial disputes act.it was a concerted action on the part of a large number of workers.the appellate tribunal was thus in error in not regarding it as a strike and it had no discretion not to regard what in law was a strike as not amounting to a strike.if it cannot be denied that the stoppage of work on 1st november. 1948. amounted to a strike. then it was certainly an illegal strike because no notice had been given to the management. the mills being a public utility industry.all the necessary ingredients..reliance was next placed on section 49. a of the factories act which provides that the provisions of the new act would not operate to the prejudice of any rights which the workers were entitled to under the earlier rules and it was arguedthese rules being in similar terms. the decision of the matter depends on the construction of the rules and this in. volves a substantial question of law.this contention cannot be sustained because section 49. a. 2. of the factories act has no application to the case of the carnatic mills in view of the notification dated 23rd august. 1946.that under the leave rules of the mills which prevailed prior to the coming into force of the factories act. the workers were entitled to privilege leave and there was no provision in those rules similar to the one that has been made in section 49. b or in the new rules and that the mills had no right to deprive them of

5th april. 1947. that the company had at the time sufficient liquid resources to effect the reduction of capital desired and so it was not necessary to resort to this process.there are usually many ways in which a given thing can be brought about in business circles but it is not for the court to decide which of them should have been employed when the court is deciding a question under section

proposition.but that again is not the point.what difference does it make if the holder of the debentures is a shareholder.to be made is that the person who took the debentures was the party who sold

orders upon tenders from the said board. and not otherwise.the raw materials mainly required for the manufacture of sleepers are pig. iron. coke. limestone and moulding sand.the effect ofin august. 1959. the said works despatched some wagons of pig iron to the appellant. but out of 20 wagons of the consignment. 14 were lost completely. and the rest misdelivered and were subsequently found somewhere in gomoh and some in tatanagar and they never reached the appellant in time.in june. 1959. the bhilai steel works made their first shipment of pig iron addressed to. the appellant.1. 00.

cash to tata iron steel co. ltd. for the pig iron supplied by it and by a letter of credit to the indian iron steel co. ltd. on which the said company used to supply the raw material made by it.thus. the alternative plea raised by the respondents to suggest that if the appellant had so desired. it could have avoided to lay. off its workmenin fact. the general manager categorically stated that the appellant had not casted any sleeper without pig iron at any time.that. in short. is the background of the lay. off. the validity of which formed the subject. matter of the present reference.subsequently. retrenchment compensation was duly paid to the workmen who had been retrenched.it was also urged by the respondents that even in the absence of pig iron. the manufacture of sleepers could have been carried on by utilising a substitute. and in support of this case. four witnesses were examined by the respondents.this lay. off con. tinued until september. 11. 1960 and from september 12. 1960. the appellant closed the sleeper foundry department and issued notice of retrenchment.it is this part. of its finding that is seriously disputed before us by the appellant.under a.the tribunals view appears to be that if reasonable care had been exercised by the appellant. the situation could have been avoided.in other words. the reference shows that it was only if the tribunal came to the conclusion that the lay. off wag not justified that the question of considering what additional compensation should be paid to the respondents could arise.2. kkk.. lay. off means.

to assume that the industrial tribunal has jurisdiction to sit in judgment over the acts of management of the employer and investigate whether a more prudent management could have avoided the situation which led to lay. off.in other words. the reference shows that it was only if the tribunal came to the conclusion that the lay. off wag not justified that the question of considering what additional compensation should be paid to the respondents could arise.it is also not in dispute that if the lay. off is malafide in the sense that the employer has deliberately and maliciously brought about a situation where lay off became necessary. then it would not be a lay. off which is justified under s. 2. kkk. and the relief provided to the laid. off workmen under a.if the lay. off is justified and it satisfies the requirements of the definition under s. 2. kkk.. the only relief to which the workmen laid off are entitled is the statutory relief prescribed by a.malafides of the employer in declaring a lay. off really mean that no lay. off. as contemplated by the definition. has in law taken place and so. a finding as to malafides of the employer in declaring a lay. off naturally takes the lay. off out of the definition of s. 2. kkk. and as such a.besides. as we have just indicated. its finding on the question of negligence is not supported by any evidence on record

moratorium the plaintiff applied to the banks branch at calcutta for facility to withdraw the whole amount but the calcutta branch raised certain technical objections against such a course.the bank

settle the claims of those workmen at lesser figures.3. 50 lacs required for building up the debenture redemption reserve is an all. engrossing need of the appellant and that is a factor which must of

protection to the tenant against ejectment.section 50 which occurs in part iv dealing with miscellaneous matters is the repeal section.the opinion expressed by the division bench on the construction of sections 12 and 50 of the act was questioned in nilkanth v. rasiklal. j.. and the matter was referred to a full bench.the full bench overruled the decision reached by the division bench on the construction of section 50 and observed that it was clear that in terms the provi. sions of the new act and the rules made thereunder are made to apply only to such suits and proceedings which are trans. ferred under the provisions of this section and that its retrospective effect is confined to what is expressly stated in section 50 of the act.we are also inclined to agree with the view of the full bench that section 12 is in terms prospective and not retrospective.it is on the other hand a repeal section in the new stat. ute.it cannot apply to suits which were already pending when the act was put on the statute book.mr. daphthary contended that the whole object of section 50 was to make provision for transfer of pending cases to courts which were given jurisdiction under the act to

in that case to the alteration in the structure of sub. section. i. its significance. as it seems to me. was not properly appreciated.this is what patanjali sastri. j.. said on this point. it is noteworthy that the first part of sub. section. 1. of section 42 providing that certain classes of income are to be deemed to accrue or arise in british india is not confined in its application to non. residents. but is in general terms so as to be applicable to both residents and non. residents.the facts that the marginal note to the whole section refers to non. residents and that the section itself finds a place in chapter v headed liability in special cases were relied upon as supporting the view that sub. section. i. as a whole applies only to non. residents.a contrary view has. no doubt. been expressed by a division bench of the bombay high court in commissioner of income. tax v. western india life insurance co.. ltd.for the reasons given above we are of the opinion that the answer re turned by the high court of bombay to the first question referred to it was wrong.there is no reason whatsoever for not giving to the palin words of the section the meaning that on the face of it they bear.construing the statute. and it may be mentioned in this connection that the marginal note relied on has since been replaced by the words income deemed to accrue or arise within british india which makes it clear that the main object of sub. section. i. was to define that expression see section 12. a. of act xxii of 1947.moreover. as above pointed out. in view of the provisions of section 14. 2.. c.. resident assessees. but for section 42. 1.. would not be liable to assessment regarding income accruing to them in part b states. even if there is a business connection in the

and so. no valid complaint can be made that anwar gave evidence in the absence of the appellant and the appellant bad no opportunity to cross. examine him.these three persons. it is alleged made their statements in the absence of the appellant.now s. 178a places the burden of proving that the goods are not smuggled goods on the person from whose possession the said goods are seized where it appears that the said goods are seized under the provisions of the sea customs act in the reasonable belief that they are smuggled goods.in our opinion. this argument is not well. founded.the last contention raised by mr. bobde was that there is nothing on record to show that the seizure of gold from the appellant had been affected by the officer concerned acting on a reasonable belief that the said gold was smuggled.therefore there is no substance in the argument that the enquiry held by the collector of central excise was conducted unfairly and the procedure adopted at the said enquiry was inconsistent with the requirements of natural justice.this large quantity of gold valued at nearly rs.of attitude adopted by the appellant. it was hardly necessary to allow the appellant to cross.

of gold by the appellant.that being so. we do not think there is any substance in the argument that the seizure was effected without a reasonable belief and so is outside section 178a.all that we can consider is whether there is ground which prima facie justifies the said reasonable belief.30. 000.. itself justified a reasonable belief in the mind of the officer that the gold may be

out these duties the polling agent advances the election prospects of the candidate. as they admittedly relate to a stage after the completion of the polling.candidate.what that passage means is that as the duty to be performed by the polling agents at the several booths is of the same character. it would be desirable that they should all be assembled and their duties explained to them.then the unused ballot papers. the tendered ballot papers and other material documents. are required to be put in separate packages. and the polling agents have the right to seal all of them.accordingly. we reaffirm the view taken by us that the appointment of a government servant as polling agent does not. without more. contravene section 123. 8..xliii of 1951 contains a prohibition against the appointment of certain persons as election agents. there is none such with. reference to the appointment of polling agents under section 46 of the act.mutual discussion and co. operation.to hold that

insurer 1000 may not comply with the central governments decision and in that case the only way to make the central governments decision effective is to refer the matter to adjudication and enable the employees to obtain an award which can be executed.that is why we think that the tribunal was right in coming to the conclusion that the reference made by the central government is invalid.be kept

to an abuse of the process of court.records and proceedings of the application and to take copies thereof.1960.d. 77 at page 82. and different from the procedure which was laid by r. 195 of the indian companies act. 1913.the high court held that the order having been initially pass ex parte an application for discharging or modifying the order was in law maintainable at the instance of the appellant but the order in so far as it directed the appellant who was a director of the company to appear before the court to be examined touching upon the affairs of the company was. in the circumstances of the case. desirable and necessary. and that the statement of the official liquidator on which the order dated january 18. 1960. was issued not being an affidavitmr. justice law rejected the application filed by the appellant. holding that the order dated january 18. 1960. was final and that he had no power to review. modify. alter or vary the same. that the order merely summoning for examination under s. 477 of the companies act did not affect a partys rights. there being no charge. no complaint and no allegation against him.the learned judges modified the order in so far as it directed production of the books of account relating to the ballygunge estate. private. ltd. and the ballygunge building society private ltd.. because those companies were not parties to the liquidation proceedings.was not required by the companies. court. rules 1959 to be kept on the file of the liquidation proceedings the statement was a confidential document and was. save by order

directions or pass such orders as may be necessary for the ends of justice or to prevent abuse of the process of court. and a direction to vacate an order previously made. is in a proper case within the courts inherent jurisdiction.the judge may. if he things fit. either in the order for examination or by any subsequent order. give directions to the specific matters on which such person is to be examined.that is an inquisitorial power. which may work with great severity against third persons. and it seems to me to be obvious that such a section ought to be used with the greatest care.the english companies act. 1948. 11 12 geo vi c. 88. on the question relating to examination of officers of the company or other persons are substantially the same as s. 477 of the indians companies act. 1956. and the principles laid down by the superior courts in england. which have been assimilated in the practice of company winding up by the courts in india are useful in determining the nature of the proceeding.the secretary refused to answer certain questions relating to the matters in issue in the action and the court held that the liquidator had shown no reason for seeking discovery except to assist him in the action and so to evade the order of the judge postponing discovery in the action and therefore the witness was justified in refusing to answer the question.it is a power of an inquisitorial kind which enables the court to direct to be examined. not merely before itself. but before the examiner appointed by the court. some third person who is no party to a litigation.in our view. the high court was right in holding that in a proper case it would be open to the company judge to vacate an ex. parte order obtained under r. 243 of the companies. court. rules.where it is satisfied that the order is vexatious. or oppressive. or where other adequate grounds exist to discharge the same.the court in that case held that the action of the liquidator was vexatious.it was held that the liquidator must satisfy the court that it would be just and beneficial for the purposes of the winding up.the liquidator who had brought an action on behalf of the company against an officer exhibited interrogatories which had been fully answered by the defendant. and thereafter. the liquidator sought an order from the court to examine the defendant under s. 115 of the companies act. 1862.so as not unnecessarily put in motion the machinery of justice when it is not wanted or to put it in motion at a stage when it is not clear that it is wanted. and certainly not to put it is motion if unnecessary mischief is going to be done or hardship inflicted upon the third person who is called upon to appear and give information.the plea of the appellant that compelling him to submit to examination without permitting him to have access to the books before answering questions put to him is oppressive has no substance.it appears also that mr. justice mitter was satisfied on the statement filed by the official liquidator that the appellant had the custody of certain important books of the company.counsel for the appellant submitted that the order for examination must be made after considering all the facts and circumstances of the case and that there was nothing on the record to show that the facts and circumstances were considered by mr. justice mitter before he made the order for examination.the high court. in appeal. expressed the view that on the merits there was no ground for interference and it was satisfied that it was desirable and necessary that the appellant as a director should be examined.the appellant has admitted in his affidavit that he was served with a copy of the order. but he has not chosen to produce it in the court of first instance. nor is the order printed in the record prepared for the use of the court in this appeal.the court has made the order in exercise of the jurisdiction vested in it and in the absence of any material to show that the order was made for a collateral purpose or by the misleading the court. the appellant is not entitled to have the order vacated.this court cannot proceed upon an assumption that the order for examination of a person who has ceased to be a director prior to the date of the winding up must necessarily be regarded as oppressive or vexatious.after considering all the facts and circumstances of the case and that there was nothing on the record to show that the facts and circumstances were considered by mr. justice mitter before he made the order for examination.in the circumstances.a director of a company. past or present. is ordinarily in a position to give useful information about the affairs of the company in winding up.if the appellant is not entitled to inspection of the statement he would certainly. for the same reason. not be entitled to a copy of that statement.of the calcutta high court. prior to the promulgation of the companies. court. rules. was different.under r. 195 an application for examination of a person under s 195 of the indian companies act 1913. could be made ex parte to the judge but it had to be by petition verified by the official liquidator

obstacle to his being joined as a respondent even after the expiry of the period of limitation prescribed for making the petition.none of these propositions however have any application if the special law itself confers authority on a tribunal to proceed with a petition in accordance with certain procedure and when it does not state the consequences of non. compliance with certain procedural requirements laid down by it.it is also well settled that it is a sound principle of natural justice that the success of a candidate who has won at an election should not be lightly interfered with

though the election of a successful candidate is not to be lightly interfered with. one of the essentials of that law is also to safeguard the purity of the election process and also to see that people do not get elected by flagrant breaches of that law or by corrupt practices.section 83 states that an election petition shall contain a concise statement of the material facts on which the petitioner relies and shall be signed by the petitioner and verified in the manner laid down in the code of civil procedure for the verification of pleadings.it further provides that the petition

parties actually on record.as regards the dictum of the lucknow tribunal that no inquiry is required to be made in the case of non. compliance with the provisions of sections 81. 83 and 117 but that an inquiry would be necessary to determine whether certain parties were nominated candidates or not. in our opinion it cannot stand scrutiny.an elaborate inquiry had to be conducted to determine the point whether the petition was typed on blank paper signed by the petitioner or whether it was signed by him or some person authorized on his behalf after it had been typed.whether a petition has been presented by a person who has purported to sign it or by someone else or whether an agent who has signed the petition is a duly authorized agent or not are its much matters of inquiry as the question

could not acquire title by adversethe learned judge held that. so far as shiddappas share was concerned. the rajinama was a complete relinquishment of his interest. but as regards annappas share. he agreed with the district judges conclusion that shiddappa could not bind annappas share by the rajinama and in this view of the matter he dismissed both the appeals.by the rajinama. shiddappa intended to convey the title in the suit land to the mortgagees and hence shiddappas heirs. the plaintiffs 1 and 2. could not claim redemption of shiddappas one half share in the suit land.1. has not come up to this court and. therefore. the decision of the division bench has become final so far as he is concerned.22 of 1945 which was filed by defendants 1 to 4 and l. p. a.the present plaintiff no.754 of 1942 against that part of the decree which rejected their claim to annappas share and the plaintiffs 1 and 2 also filed second appeal no.1011 of 1942 against the dismissal of their claim for redemption of one half share of shiddappa in the mortgaged property.as pointed out by the division bench in their judgment in the letters patent appeal. this case of shiddappa having acted as karta was nowhere made by the defendants. appellants in their written statement and. in agreement with the high court. we declined to allow learned advocate for the appellants to make out such a new case.1. has not come up to this court and. therefore. the decision of the division bench has become final so far as he is concerned.section 74 of the bombay land revenue act. as it stood at all material times. ran as follows an occupant may. by giving written notice to the mamlatdar or mahalkari. relinquish his occupancy. either absolutely or in favour of a specified person provided that such relinquishment applied to the entire occupancy or to whole survey numbers. or recognized shares of survey numbers.this case being thus out of the way. learned advocate for the appellants urges that under s. 74 of the bombay land revenue code. as shiddappa was the registered occupant. the rajinama filed by him operated upon the entire occupancy and amounted to a relinquishment of the rights of both the brothers shiddappa and annappa.we are unable to accept this argument as correct.the concluding paragraph of the section clearly recognises that a relinquishment may be in favour of more persons than one.from time to time prescribed in this behalf for each district by the governor in council.this is for facilitating the purpose of the code but it does not mean that the other persons in whose favour the occupancy is relinquished cease to have any right.it is true that the principal one of such persons must enter into a written agreement to become the registered occupant..in lalchand sakharam marwadi v. khendu kedu ughade. 1. one out of four brother mortgagors. who was the registered occupant of the mortgage land. passed a rajinama of the land in favour of the mortgagee. who executed a kabuliyat for the same.it was held that though the conveying brother was a co. mortgagor with the plaintiffs. he had no right to sell their interest in the equity of redemption and that. so far as they. were concerned. he was in the same position as an outsider.where there are more occupants than one. the notice of relinquishment on behalf of any occupant must be given by the registered occupant.the bombay land revenue code. but the actual decision in that case. the facts of which are very similar to those of the instant case. quite clearly indicates the courts understanding of the law applicable to those facts and that law was nothing but the provisions of s. 74 of the code.the registered occupant attracts the operation of the code and confers certain rights or imposes certain obligations on the registered occupant as laid down in the code but does not take away the rights of other occupants.',\n"," '1954_13.txt': '1954.the high court disagreed

rashmoni died.ur of sarat kumar das could pass only the right. title and interest of rashmoni and could not affect the reversionary rights of the plaintiffs.on the first point both the courts below have held concurrently. that there was absolutely no legal necessity which justified the execution of the security bond by rashmoni in favour of suhasini.3 on the other and this dispute centered.the contentions. though somewhat plausible at first sight. seem to us to be wholly without substance.on the first point both the courts below have held concurrently. that there was absolutely no legal necessity which justified the execution of the security bond by rashmoni in favour of suhasini.it may be. that it was notthe execution of the security bond therefore was an act beneficial to the estate of haripada.in the first place the money borrowed by mohini or deposited by him in court did not and could not benefit haripadas estate at all.it is said that this was not a mere moral obligation but a legal liability on the part of the lady. as mohini could have claimed contribution from her to the extent that haripadas estate was benefited by the deposit.the high court has rightly pointed out that rashmoni did not execute the bond to raise any money to pay off her share of the deposit and in fact no necessity for raising money for that purpose at all existed at that time.even if the release of the estate was considered to be desirable. that had been already accomplished by mohini who borrowed money on his own responsibility.the utmost that could be said was that rashmoni was bound to reimburse mohini to the extent that the deposit of money by mohini had benefited the estate of haripada.20. 950 only were required to be deposited in court.but the most important thing that would require consideration is the state of things actually existing at the time when the security bond was executed.the second point urged by mr. chatterjee raises the question as to whether the fact of mohinis joining his mother in executing the security bond would make the transaction binding on the actual reversioner. mohini being admittedly the presumptive reversioner of haripada at the date of the transaction.but by no stretch of imagination could it be regarded as a prudent act on the part of a hindu female heir which was necessary for the protection of the estate of the last male holder.money by mohini had benefited the estate of haripada.the high court has rightly pointed out that rashmoni did not execute the bond to raise any money to pay off her share of the deposit and in fact no necessity for raising money for that purpose at all existed at that time.but this.mr. chatterjee placed considerable reliance upon another document which purports to be a deed of declaration and was executed by ram narayan on the 5th of october. 1918.protection of the estate of the last male holder.this deed purports to be addressed to bangshidari ghosh and keshav dutt. two other alienees of the properties of mohini and haripada and does not amount to a representation made to the auction purchaser annada prasad ghose or to the father of the present appellants.mohini being the immediate reversioner who joined in the execution of the security bond must be deemed to have consented to the transaction.this contention of the appellant must therefore fail.the third and the last contention raised by mr. chatterjee is that in any event his client is aas the sons of ram narayan claim as heirs of haripada and not of their father. the admissions. if any. made by the latter could not in any way bind them.1.this proposition. their lordships observed. was opposed both to principle and authority. it being a settled doctrine of hindu law that nobody has a vested right so long as the widow is alive and the eventual reversioner does not claim through anyone who went before him.72. 84.approved of by the judicial committee in gounden v. gounden. 46 i. a.this contention of the appellant must therefore fail.72 at 83. 84.vide the collector of masaulipatam v. cavaly venkata. m. i. a.u law that nobody has a vested right so long as the widow is alive and the eventual reversioner does not claim through anyone who went before him.in our opinion the contention formulated in this form really involves a misconception of the legal position of an alienee of a hindu widows property.the interest of a hindu widow in the pro. perties inherited by her bears no analogy or resemblance to what may be described as an equitable estate in english law and which cannot be followed in the hands of a bonafide purchaser for value without notice.in our opinion the view taken by the high court is quite proper.whatever enquiries the appellants may have made. 1. 6 m. i. a. would be of no avail to them when the alienation is not binding on the whole estate but only on the womans estate of rashmoni.the subsequent transferee could not claim to have acquired any higher right than what his predecessor had and it is immaterial whether he bona fide paid the purchase money or took proper legal advice.in this case the alienation was by way of mortgage.there is no necessity in fact or if the alienee could not prove that he made bona fide enquiries and was satisfied about its existence. the transfer is undoubtedly not void but the transferee would get only the widows estate in the property which does not affect in any way the interest of the reversioner.',\n"," '1951_40.txt': 'in our opinion. the contention raised by the learned attorney. general is sound.the high court was in error in

are of opinion that the illegitimate son of a sudra by a continuous concubine has the status of a son. and that he is a member of the family that the share of inheritance given to him is not merely in lieu of maintenance. but in recognition of his status as a son it is not necessary to multiply decisions.sir lawrence jenkins observed at p. 37 thus here the contest is between the illegitimate son and the widow. and though the widow is not named in the text it is well settled that as a preferential heir to the daughters son she is included among those who share with the illegitimate son. and it would serve no useful purpose to speculate why she was not mentioned in the text.when the succession opens. in a competition between an illegitimate son and other reversioners. the illegitimate son is certainly a nearer heir to the last male holder than the other reversioners.1. only such share as his father may give him.the cases on the subject their lordships are of opinion that the illegitimate son of a sudra by a continuous concubine has the status of a son. and that he is a member of the family that the share of inheritance given to him is not merely in lieu of maintenance. but in

lodged the fir before s. h. o police station chechat regarding the alleged assault on the deceased by the accused persons.the accused persons denied the charge and pleaded false implication and

a 1.the high court has confirmed the conviction and sentence of a 1 passed by the trial court.aggrieved by the order of conviction and sentence passed by the trial court the accused persons had filed appeals before the high court.the trial court placing reliance on the evidence of pw 6 has convicted and sentenced the accused persons under section 302 read with section 34 of the ipc to suffer imprisonment for life and to pay a fine of rs1000 each and in default to undergo simple imprisonment for a further period of six months.however the high court has acquitted a 2 only on the ground that a 2 had not actively participated in the commission of the offence and therefore the trial court was not justified in convicting a 2 for an offence punishable under section 302 read with section 34 of the ipc.in order to satisfy ourselves we have once again carefully analyzed the evidence on record and the conviction of a 1 by the trial court with the aid of the sole eye witness of pw 6.while considering the appeal filed by the state of rajasthan we have carefully perused the judgment and order passed by the high court.it is thus an exception to the general rule of criminal jurisprudence that it is the primary responsibility of the person who actually commits a crime and only that person can be held guilty andthe high court has acquitted a 2 only on the ground that merely sitting on the chest of the deceased rules out the possibility of active participation by a 2 in the commission of offence and therefore has acquitted him from the charges under section 302 read with section 34 of the ipc.section 34 of ipc enacts that when a criminal act is done by several persons in furtherance of the common intention of all each of such persons is liable for that act in the same manner as if it were done by him alone.the essence of that liability is found in the existence of common intention animating the accused leading to the doing of a criminal act in furtherance of such intention.the section is intended to meet a case in which it is difficult to distinguish between the act of individual members of a party and to prove exactly what part was played by each of them.15.a perusal of section 34 of the ipc would clearly indicate that there must be two ingredients for convicting a person with the aid of section 34 of the ipc.it is thus clear that the criminal act referred to in section 34 ipc is the result of the concerted action of more than one person if the said result was reached in furtherance of the common intention and each person must be held liable for the ultimate result as if he had done it himself.firstly there must be a common intention and secondly there must be participation by the accused persons in furtherance of the common intention.it has come in the evidence of pw 6 that a 1 was assaulting the deceased with stones and a 2 was sitting on the chest of the deceased.on the said date of incident the animosity culminated to an assault on the deceased by the accused persons when the deceased was nearing his land.a 1 and a 2 had a common intention to assault and kill the deceased person with a 2 as a participant in the crime with the intention of lending weight to the commission of an offence pursuant to a pre concerted plan.actually committing the planned crime.',\n"," '1954_0.txt': 'there is no substantial dispute as to the

of the president and this having been done. it was for the president either to assent to the bill or to withhold his assent.in my opinion. the argument is fallacious.this contention fails for the reasons given in my judgment in the bihar case.next it was contended that the obligation to pay compensation was implicit in the legislative power contained in entry 36 of list ii and that the act was unconstitutional as it had provided for acquisition of zamindaris without payment of compensation. the provisions relating to it being illusory.the provisions of article 31. 4. support the view of the learned attorney. general that what has to be sent to the president is the bill as passed by the legislature and not the bill after it has been assented to by the governor.it would be a meaningless formality for the president to give his assent to the same bill twice over.this word has not the same meaning in all the articles.the contention that there is no public purpose behind the impugned act has also to be repelled on the same reasoning as given by me in the bihar case.the next argument of mr. somayya that the act is a fraud on the constitution in that in legislating under entry 42 of list iii. it has legislated for non. payment of compensation has also to be repelled. for the reasons given in the bihar case.it is too late in the day to contend that reform in this directions is not

dismissed.iii. p. 541.the passage. however read in its entirety. negatives the contention.it was contended that by the terms of the covenant of merger those properties were declared as the petitioners private properties and were protected from state legislation by the guarantee given in article 362 of the constitution and hence the impugned act was bad as it contravened the provisions of this article.it may be mentioned that under powers of compulsory acquisition a number of properties have been nationalized in england and other countries.the constitution had not even come into force by the time that most of these statutes were enacted.the properties belonging to the petitioner and acquired under the statute were originally situate in an indian state which became subsequently merged with madhya pradesh.there is no evidence whatsoever that all these enactments were enacted with a fraudulent design of defeating the provisions of payment of compensation contained in the constitution.this petition is accordingly dismissed but there will be no order of costs.for the reasons given inmoreover it seems to me that in view of the comprehensive language of article 363 this

orders restraining the state of madhya pradesh from acting under that act and disturbing the petition title to. and possession of their respective estates. villages or properties.there is no dispute as to the correctness of the dates given to us by counsel for the petitioners.the speaker then read out the motion.the next of the bill as it emerged through. the house was printed on 29th april. 1950. and speaker signed a copy of the printedit was referred to a select committee on 15th october 1949.the select committee made its report on 9th march. 1950. which was presented to the assembly on 29th march. 1950.the assembly considered the bill in the light of the report between that date and 5th april 1950. during which period the amendments proposed by the selected committee were moved and disposed of.shows that the house accepted the bill.there is no evidence on affidavit by anybody who wasthere being a presumption of regularity attached to all official business the onus is undoubtedly on the petitioners to allege and prove that the procedure prescribed by the rules was not followed.it only shows that the house passed on to discuss another bill. namely the madhya pradesh state aid to industries. amendment. bill. 1950.the objection formulated by learned counsel for the petitioners is founded is founded on the rules of procedure framed by the assembly under section 84 of the government of india act. 1953 which were continued in force until new rules were farmed under article 208 of the constitution.what is contended is that the provisions of old rule 20. 1. have not been followed.the petitioners rely only on the absence in the official report of proceedings of any mention of the question being put to or carried by the assembly.a member.i have already pointed out that the original printed act produced before us clearly shows that on 5th may 1950. the speaker certified that the bill had been passed by the assembly.this does not appear to me to be a correct approach to the problem.it is urged that the question that the bill be passed into law was not to the assembly under rule 20 and if it was at all put the result of the voting. whether by voices or division. was never announced by the speaker as required by old rule 34.the certification of the speaker was within a month from 5th april 1950. while the confirmation of the proceedings took place on 1st october. 1950.appear to me to be a correct approach to the problem.i am not impressed by the argument founded on the fine distinction sought to be made between an irregularity of procedure and on omission to take a particular step in the procedure.further the speeches delivered by the eleven speakers clearly indicate that the stage there was no opposition the bill.the petitioners as i have said. strongly rely on the official report of the proceedings.the question before us is whether as a matter of fact the bill had duly passed according to the rules.the certification of the speaker was within a month from 5th april 1950. while the confirmation of the proceedings took place on 1st october. 1950.bunch of reports of proceedings.re.i am unable to accept this line of reasoning.. cannot be given any legal validity and the argument founded on authentication under defunct rule 115. 2. must lose all its force.validity of the act is not well. founded and must be rejected.finally. the irregularity of procedure. if any. is expressly cured by article 212.i am not impressed by the argument founded on the fine distinction sought to be made between an irregularity of procedure and on omission to take a particular step in the procedure.under that article. the governor can do one of three things. namely he may declare that he assentssuch an omission in my opinion is nothing more than an irregularity of procedure.the whole arguments is built on the word law.in the latter event happening. the argument of the learned counsel for the petitioners will require that what has become a law by the assent of the president will. in order to be effective. have to be again reserved for the consideration of the president. a curious conclusion i should be loath to reach unless i am compelled to do so.for one thing. it assumes that a bill passed by the state assembly can become a law only by the assent of the governor.i do not think that what is referred to as law in article 31. 3. is necessarily hat had already become a law before receiving the assent of the president.the question whether the requirements of article 31. 3. have been complied with will arise only when the state purports to acquire the property of any person under a law and thatthe procedure to be followed after a bill is passed by the state assembly is laid down in article 200.in my opinion there is no substance in the second objection which must. therefore. be over ruled.mr. n. s. bindra and mr. swami have sought to reinforce those argument by citing certain further passager from certain text books and reported decisions.the words has received his assent clearly imply and point to an accomplished fact and the clause read as a whole does not grammatically exclude a law that eventually become a law by having had received the assent to the president.thus it is open to the petitioners to show that the legislature had no power to enact the law or that it offends against any other provision of the constitution.the provisions of the impugned act have been analysed and summarised by mahajan j. in the judgmentin other words. the word law has been used to mean what at the time of dispute purpose to be or is asserted to be a law.thus it is open to the petitioners to show that the legislature had no power to enact the law or that it offends against any other provision of the constitution.in any event the act cannot. for reasons stated by me in my judgment in the bihar appeals. be questioned on the ground of absence of public purpose or of compensation.of the gross income.further the compensation provided in the madhya pradesh act is more liberal than that provided in the bihar act. for under clause 4. 2. of schedule i the net income can in no case be reduced to less than 5 per cent.it can. nevertheless. be challenged on other grounds.re. g. the last ground of attack is that the 80 malaguzari mahals belonging to the petitioner in petition no.referred to above may well have been conceived and undertaken from time to time in utmost good faith.further under section 10 the state government is bound to direct payment of an interim compensation amounting to one. tenth of the estimated amount of compensation if the whole amount is not paid within a period of six months from the date of vesting of the property in the state.learned advocate. general of madhya pradesh concedes that these malguzari mahals are not estates within the meaning of the c. p. land revenue act but contends that the word estate has been used in a larger sense in article 31. a.i do not think it necessary to discuss the meaning of the word estate as used in article 31. a for in my opinion. the argument of the learned advocate. general founded on article 31. b is well. founded and ought to prevail.a question was raised by mr. asthana appearing for the ruler of khairagarh who is the petitioner in petition no.mr. b. somayya has drawn our attention to the words without prejudice to the generality of the provisions of article 31. a occurring in the beginning of article 31. b and contended that the interpretation put upon these words by the judicial committee in shibnath banerjees case.. 1945. l. r.opinion. the argument of the learned advocate. general founded on article 31. b is well. founded and ought to prevail.further this article does not import any legal obligation but is an assurance only.the words referred to were used obviously to prevent any possible argument that article 30. b cut down the scope or ambit of the general words used in article 31. a.72 i. a.khairagarh is one of the states which formerly fell within the eastern states agency.all that the covenant does is to recognise the title of the ruler as owner of certain properties.finally.

not have taken the unusual course of giving a fresh opportunity to the complainant to have second round of litigation. to the great prejudice of the accused.that was a very important piece of evidence. which if genuine could go a long way to prove the case against the appellant.in one sense that comment was justified but in a case of this kind between lawyer and client we think the matter cannot be left. where it is.according to the prosecution it clearly showed the respondents connection with the sum of rs.5000... the subject matter of the charge.it is true that expert evidence cannot always be a final settler still in a call of this kind. it is eminently desirable that the court should be assisted by a qualified expert since almost the whole case depends upon proof of the fact

entitled to rewrite an act.offending provisions can be struck out but if we do that the whole act goes because the defect here is that all sales are permitted to be taxed provided they are within the state of bombay. and the rulemaking authority is not restricted to taxation which is constitutionally permissible.on the question of severability. i cannot see how the good can be separated from the bad in this case even if the explanation to section 2. 14. be expunged unless the constitution be read as part of the act and we are to read into the act some such provision as follows notwithstanding anything which is said in any part of this act. all sales which the state is prohibited to tax under the constitution are excluded from the scope of this act.see badische aniline und soda fabrick v. basle chemical works. bind schedler. 1. and badische aniline und soda fabrick v. hickson. 2. the situs or location of the sale or purchase therefore assumed an importance under article 286 and the constitution makers had before them not only the legislative practice prevailing in the various states before the constitution but also the concept of sale as defined in the indian sale of goods act.. 2. 1906 a. conce the transfer of ownership or the passing of the property in the goods was accepted as the sole criterion of taxability it was not necessary at all to define what was a sale or purchase which took place 1117 inside the state.besides this ingredient there were various other ingredients which had been similarly considered sufficient territorial connections and to consider that the ingredient of the passing of property in the goods was the only ingredient which was considered important to be mentioned in the non. obstante clause is to ignore the facts and do violence to the whole conception underlying the incorporation of the non. obstante clause in the explanation.that does not however mean that it is only the delivery state which will be entitled to tax the sale or purchase.it would be a more natural way of reading the non. obstante clause to read into it an intention to state what according to the constitution makers was the basic idea of fixing the situs or the location of the sale or purchase in the place where the transfer of ownership took place or the property in the goods passed and to indicate that notwithstanding that fact a sale or purchase which fell within the category mentioned in the explanation was none. the. less to be deemed to have taken place inside the delivery state.under the general law relating to the sale of goods the property in the goods having by reason of such sale or purchase passed in another state that state will no doubt be entitled to tax the sale or purchase as having taken place inside the state.the object of article 286 is to impose restrictions on the imposition of tax on sale or purchase of goods and the only restriction which has been imposed in connection with the sales or purchases which take place in this manner is that a state shall not impose a tax on the sale or purchase of goods where such sale or purchase takes place outside the state.in order to arrive at a conclusion whether the object and purpose of the explanation was to enable the delivery state to tax such sales or purchases either in addition to the state in which the property in the goods had passed or in substitution thereof one has got to bear in mind the basic idea that a state would normally be entitled to tax a sale or purchase where such sale or purchase took place inside the state except in cases covered by article 286. 1.. b. and article 286. 2..it is no doubt true that in the explanation the word only has not been used nor has the word also been used and we have to gather the purpose of the enactment of the explanation from the words of the explanation itself.according to the position as discussed above both the states would thus be entitled to tax such sales or purchases.where such sale or purchase took place inside the state except in cases covered by article 286. 1.. b. and article 286. 2..that sale or purchase has to be one as a direct result of which the goods have actually been delivered in the delivery state for the purpose of consumption in that state.if this position is borne in mind it is clear that not only would the state in which the property in the goods passed continue to be entitled to tax the sale or purchase because of such sale or purchase having taken place inside the state. but the delivery state would also be entitled to tax such sale or purchase by reason of the operation of the legal fiction in so far as the goods have actually been delivered as a direct result of such sale or purchase in the delivery state for the. purpose of consumption in that state.as a matter of physical fact it is in the book case a.before i proceed to discuss the effect of article 286. 2. on the taxing powers of both the states it is necessary to consider what is the exact type of sale or purchase which is covered by the explanation.the word consumption has been thus defined in websters new international dictionary. vol. 1. page 483. consumption... 3. economics. the use of. economic. goods resulting in the diminution or destruction of their utilities opposed to production.generally. it may be said that consumption means using things. and production means adapting them for use.it is only a transaction of sale or purchase directly results in the delivery of goods 1123 for the purpose of consumption in the delivery state that comes within the category of transactions covered by the explanation.econ.according to the position as discussed above both the states would thus be entitled to tax such sales or purchases.we have however got to take count of article 286. 2..in my opinion they have reference only to immediate consumption within the state and no further.econ.the transaction of. such sale or purchase even though it be as between a dealer in the one state and the consumer in the delivery state is nonetheless a transaction in the course of inter. state trade or commerce.if the matters stood thus and there was no further provision to be considered the position would be that in a transaction of sale or purchase covered by the explanation construed as above both the state in which the property in the goods passed and the delivery state would be entitled to tax such sale or purchase. the former by reason of the property in the goods having passed inside that state and the latter by reason of the goods having been delivered as a direct result of such sale or purchase for the purpose of consumption in that state.whether a transaction of sale or purchase takes place between a dealer on the one hand and a dealer on the other or between a dealer on the one hand and a consumer on the other in theother.. beal on the cardinal rules of legal interpretation. 3rd edition. part viiit is a well. known rule of the interpretation of statutes that a particular enactment is not repealed by a general enactment in the same statute.xviii construction of statutes at p. 265 section 167..reliance is 1126 placed in support of the above proposition on the following observations of best c. j. in churchill v. crease. 1... see also craies on statute law. 5th edition. 1952. at p. 205 maxwell on the interpretation of statutes 9th edition.it therefore follows that the general provision which is enacted in article 286. 2. against the imposition of tax on the sale or purchase of goods in the course of inter. state trade or commerce should give way to the special provision which is enacted in the explanation to article 286. 1.. a. enabling the delivery state to tax such sale or purchase in the limited class of cases covered by the explanation. transactions. covered by the explanation being thus lifted out of the category of transactions. in the course of inter. state trade or commerce covered by article 286. 2. and assimilated to transactions of sale or purchase which take place inside the state thus acquiring an intrastate character so far as the delivery state is concerned.i would therefore base my. construction of the explanation to article 286. 1.. a. and article 286. 2. on the rule as to the interpretation of statutes which. 1828. 5 bing. 177 at p. 180.. 2.. 1876. 1 ex.article 286 and article 304. a. refer to different states of affairs.of cases covered by the explanation. transactions. covered by the explanation being thus lifted out of the category of transactions. in the course of inter. state trade or commerce covered by article 286. 2. and assimilated to transactions of sale or purchase which take place inside the state thus acquiring an intrastate character so far as the delivery state is concerned.i agree that the bombay sales tax act. 1952. and the rules made. thereunder except rule 5. 2.. 1. do not contravene the provisions of article 286. that rule 5. 2.. 1. is clearly severable and can be ignored. that there is no substance in the contention of shri seervai that there is a violation of the fundamental rights guaranteed under article 14 and that the taxation statutes should be construed in a manner so as to allow the statute itself to stand. the taxing authority being prevented by injunction from imposing the tax on subjects excluded by the constitution from the purview of taxation by the state.such transaction would be a transaction of sale or purchase where as a direct result of such sale or purchase the goods are delivered in the delivery state for the purpose of consumption in that state i. e.. where the transaction is between a dealer in the state in which the property in the goods passes and a consumer in the delivery state.i have referred to above. lifting the transaction of sale or purchase covered by the explanation to article 286. 1.. a. out of the category of the transactions in the course of inter. state trade or commerce and assimilating it to 1128 a transaction of sale or purchase which takes place inside the delivery state thus investing it with the character of an intrastate sale qua the delivery state.the result therefore is that the delivery state only would be entitled to tax the transaction of sale or purchase covered by the explanation.',\n"," '2003_794.txt': 'therefore this decision in isha marbles cannot be taken advantage of by the appellant at all in this case.that this aspect is under consideration in another matter before this court.the said rule clearly indicates that it is a mode of recovery of the excise dues

case it is entirely in the power of the appellant to deposit the tax if he chooses to do so whereas it was not within the power of the appellant in that case to secure a certificate from the learned

this argument cannot prevail in view of the decision of the calcutta high court in nagendra nath bose v. mon mohan singha. supra..wholly inapplicable in such a situation and the jurisdiction of the authority has to be exercised under the old law which so continues to exist.there can be no doubt that the new requirement touches the substantive right of appeal vested in the appellant.for the purposes of the accrual of the right of appeal the critical and relevant date is the date of initiation of the proceedings and not the decision itself.indeed the new requirement cannot be said merely to regulate the exercise of the appellants pre. existing right but in truth whittles down the right itself and cannot be regarded as a mere rule of procedure.further. even if the lis is to be taken as arising only on the date of assessment. there was a possibility of such a lis arising as soon as proceedings started with the filing of the return or. at any rate. when the authority called for

nos.with pay as provided by the act.the decision of the management was varied to this extent.he. however. considered that the total deprivation of leave with pay ordered by the management was a severe punishment and on the assumption that he had power to scrutinize the exercise of the discretion by the management in awarding punishment. reduced the punishment by 50 per cent and held that the workers would be deprived of only half their holidays with pay.the adjudicator gave the award which was published in the gazette on 12th october. 1950.in view of this finding he upheld the view of the management that the continuity of service of the workers was broken by the interruption caused by the illegal strike and that as a consequence the workers who participated in such strike were not entitled to annual holidays with pay under section 49. b. 1. of the factories act..section 2 qwe have not been able to appreciate the view expressed by the appellate tribunal that stoppage of work for a period of two to four hours and such non. permitted absence from work cannot be regarded as strike.he further hold that the refusal of the workers to resume work in spite of the attempts made by the officers and their own madras labour union representatives indicated that they were not as a body prepared to resume work unless their demand was conceded.that being so. the action of the workers on the night of the 1st november clearly fell within the definition of the expression strike in section 2. q. of the industrial disputes act.it was a concerted action on the part of a large number of workers.the appellate tribunal was thus in error in not regarding it as a strike and it had no discretion not to regard what in law was a strike as not amounting to a strike.if it cannot be denied that the stoppage of work on 1st november. 1948. amounted to a strike. then it was certainly an illegal strike because no notice had been given to the management. the mills being a public utility industry.all the necessary ingredients..reliance was next placed on section 49. a of the factories act which provides that the provisions of the new act would not operate to the prejudice of any rights which the workers were entitled to under the earlier rules and it was arguedthese rules being in similar terms. the decision of the matter depends on the construction of the rules and this in. volves a substantial question of law.this contention cannot be sustained because section 49. a. 2. of the factories act has no application to the case of the carnatic mills in view of the notification dated 23rd august. 1946.that under the leave rules of the mills which prevailed prior to the coming into force of the factories act. the workers were entitled to privilege leave and there was no provision in those rules similar to the one that has been made in section 49. b or in the new rules and that the mills had no right to deprive them of leave by reason of the strike.', '1951_64.txt':

time sufficient liquid resources to effect the reduction of capital desired and so it was not necessary to resort to this process.there are usually many ways in which a given thing can be brought

otherwise.the raw materials mainly required for the manufacture of sleepers are pig. iron. coke. limestone and moulding sand.the effect ofin august. 1959. the said works despatched some wagons of pig iron to the appellant. but out of 20 wagons of the consignment. 14 were lost completely. and the rest misdelivered and were subsequently found somewhere in gomoh and some in tatanagar and they never

it and by a letter of credit to the indian iron steel co. ltd. on which the said company used to supply the raw material made by it.thus. the alternative plea raised by the respondents to suggest that if the appellant had so desired. it could have avoided to lay. off its workmenin fact. the general manager categorically stated that the appellant had not casted any sleeper without pig iron at any time.that. in short. is the background of the lay. off. the validity of which formed the subject. matter of the present reference.subsequently. retrenchment compensation was duly paid to the workmen who had been retrenched.it was also urged by the respondents that even in the absence of pig iron. the manufacture of sleepers could have been carried on by utilising a substitute. and in support of this case. four witnesses were examined by the respondents.this lay. off con. tinued until september. 11. 1960 and from september 12. 1960. the appellant closed the sleeper foundry department and issued notice of retrenchment.it is this part. of its finding that is seriously disputed before us by the appellant.under a.the tribunals view appears to be that if reasonable care had been exercised by the appellant. the situation could have been avoided.in other words. the reference shows that it was only if the tribunal came to the conclusion that the lay. off wag not justified that the question of considering what additional compensation should be paid to the respondents could arise.2. kkk.. lay. off means. inter alia. the failure. or inability of an employer on account of shortage

only if the tribunal came to the conclusion that the lay. off wag not justified that the question of considering what additional compensation should be paid to the respondents could arise.it is also not in dispute that if the lay. off is malafide in the sense that the employer has deliberately and maliciously brought about a situation where lay off became necessary. then it would not be a lay. off which is justified under s. 2. kkk. and the relief provided to the laid. off workmen under a.if the lay. off is justified and it satisfies the requirements of the definition under s. 2. kkk.. the

we have just indicated. its finding on the question of negligence is not supported by any evidence on record nor by probabilities in the case.apart from. the fact that this conclusion does not appear

not necessary in this appeal to consider whether because of an agreement to pay interest the relationship may be deemed to be of debtor and creditor. because it was held by both the courts below that no such agreement is proved. and according to the settled practice of this court the finding is regarded a binding.after the purpose for which the moneys were entrusted was carried out. in the absence of further instructions the defendant did not cease to be a trustee.it is immaterial that the bank purported to open fixed deposit account in the name of the plaintiff with the amounts received at its head office at lahore.but this presumption is one of fact arising from the nature of the business carried on by the bank and is rebutted by proof of special instructions. or circumstances attending

on preference share capital and the amount of rs.we are of the opinion that the tribunal was not justified in allowing the sum of rs.63.2. 50. 000 which had been actually provided for the purpose in the balance. sheet. negativing the contention of the respondents that no provision should be allowed for debenture redemption fund in the bonus formula.3. 50. 000 for the purposes of bonus formula was clearly untenable.no annual provision had been made from profits for redemption of the same inasmuch as until the year 1949 the appellant was not working at a profit.in so far as 7 more years were left before the due date for redemption the appellant claimed rs.2. 50. 000 had been made by it for debenture redemption reserve.2. 50. 000.. for debenture redemption fund as a prior charge in the bonus calculations.75. 000 for debenture redemption fund. for 1951. 52. rs.3. 39 lacs on an all. india basis.the only question which therefore survives is what further bonus. if any. would the respondents be entitled to from the distributable surplus of rs.before us would have an advantage over those workmen with whom settlements have been made and would get larger amounts by way of bonus merely by reason of the fact that the appellant had managed to settle the claims of those workmen at lesser figures.3. 50 lacs required for building up the debenture redemption reserve is an all. engrossing need of the appellant and that is a factor which must of necessity be taken into consideration while arriving at the ultimate figure. particularly because such redemption of the debentures

pending ap. peals which had been excluded from its ambit. 9.. that act lvii of 1947 had been amended by bombay act iii of 1949 and that the appeal pending in this court should be decided in accordance with the provisions of the amended act which excluded pending appeals from the purview of act lvii of 1947 and. 3. that the high court wrongly reversed the trial courts finding that the respondents had committed breaches of the terms contained in clause 2. 20. of the lease.in our opinion. the decision of the appeal depends solely on the construction of sections 12 and 50 of act lvii of 1947.we should not howev. er be taken to concur in all the reasons given by the high court for reversing that finding.section 12 of the act is in these terms. a landlord shall not be entitled to the recovery of possession of any premises so long as the tenant pays. or is ready and willing to pay. the amount of the standard rent and permitted increases. if any. and observes and performs the other conditions of the tenancy. in so far as they are consistent with the provisions ofthat act lvii of 1947 had been amended by bombay act iii of 1949 and that the appeal pending in this court should be

that the respondents had committed breaches of the terms contained in clause 2. 20. of the lease.into force the answer to this question depends on the construction to be placed on sections 12 and 50 of act lvii of 1947.this is the substantive section giving protection to the tenant against ejectment.section 50 which occurs in part iv dealing with miscellaneous matters is the repeal section.the opinion expressed by the division bench on the construction of sections 12 and 50 of the act was questioned in nilkanth v. rasiklal. j.. and the matter was referred to a full bench.the full bench overruled the decision reached by the division bench on the construction of section 50 and observed that it was clear that in terms the provi. sions of the new act and the rules made thereunder are made to apply only to such suits and proceedings which are trans. ferred under the provisions of this section and that its retrospective effect is confined to what is expressly stated in section 50 of the act.we are also inclined to agree with the view of the full bench that section 12 is in terms prospective and not retrospective.it is on the other hand a repeal section in the new stat. ute.it cannot apply to suits which were already pending when the act was put on the statute book.mr. daphthary contended that the whole object of section 50 was to make provision for transfer of pending cases to courts which were given jurisdiction under the act to hear them and the section did not concern itself with the extent of the retrospective operation of the act. and that section 12 of the act which gives protection to tenants should a. i. r. 1949 bom.sub. section. 3. which gives the right to the tenant to pay or tender the rent at the hearing of the suit only applies to those suits

exceptional circumstances by resorting to the powers conferred by ss.the legislature in its wisdom has thought that suits of certain types should be decided in stages and though the suit in such cases can be regarded as fully and completely decided only after a final decree is made the decision of the court arrived at the earlier stage also has a finality attached to it.it would be relevant to

accrue or arise in british india is not confined in its application to non. residents. but is in general terms so as to be applicable to both residents and non. residents.the facts that the marginal

evidence was recorded by the collector of central excise in the enquiry before him. were not produced for cross. examination by the appellant.a is also applicable.this statement was accepted by mr. sorabji who appeared for the appellant and so. no valid complaint can be made that anwar gave evidence in the absence of the appellant and the appellant bad no opportunity to cross. examine him.these three persons. it is alleged made their statements in the absence of the appellant.now s. 178a places the burden of proving that the goods are not smuggled goods on the person from whose possession the said goods are seized where it appears that the said goods are seized under the provisions of the sea customs act in the reasonable belief that they are smuggled goods.in our opinion. this argument is not well. founded.the last contention raised by mr. bobde was that there is nothing on record to show that the seizure of gold from the appellant had been affected by the officer concerned acting on a reasonable belief that the said gold was smuggled.therefore there is no substance in the argument that the enquiry held by the collector of central excise was conducted unfairly and the procedure adopted at the said enquiry was inconsistent with the requirements of natural justice.this large quantity of gold valued at nearly rs.of attitude adopted by the appellant. it was hardly necessary to allow the appellant to cross. examine the said two witnesses.in that connection. it may not be irrelevant to remember that the said officer had received positive information in the month of september. 1956. regarding the smuggling of gold by the appellant.that being so. we do not think there is any substance in the argument that the seizure was effected without a reasonable belief and so is outside section 178a.all that we can consider is whether there is ground which prima facie justifies the said reasonable belief.30. 000.. itself justified a reasonable belief in the mind of the

difficult for them to obtain suitable alternative employment in the off season.to say that. is. however. not to say that the industry where they are seasonally employed should look on unconcerned and

termination of mr. banerjees services wasthis report was sent on november 24. 1959.that. in brief. is the case set out by the appellant in support of the action taken by it against mr. banerjee.he found that mr. banerjee was networking satisfactorily as a salesman.thereupon. mr. gupta made a report to the zonal manager on november 2. 1959. adversely commenting on mr. banerjees work.the appellant. therefore. urged that the labour court had no jurisdiction to consider the propriety of the appellants action in discharging mr. banerjee.made another report expressing his dissatisfaction with the explanation given by mr. banerjee.the respondents. on the other hand. contended that the discharge was not discharge simpliciter but was. in substance. dismissal. and so. it was urged that the labour court was entitled to consider the propriety of the appellants action.basing themselves on the plea that the discharge amounted to dismissal. the respondents pleaded that the failure of the appellant to hold an enquiry against mr. banerjee introduced a serious infirmity in the order passed against him and they argued that the conduct of the appellant was malafide and the dismissal of mr. banerjee amounted to victimisation.setalvad on behalf of the appellant.in some cases. the termination of the employees services may appear to the industrial court to be capricious or so unreasonably severe that an inherence may legitimately and reasonably be drawn that in terminating the services. the employer was not acting bonafide.it is true that in several cases. contract of employment or provisions in standing orders authorise an industrial employer to terminate the service. of his employees.having considered that evidence. the labour court has found that the respondents plea about the mala fides of the appellant was not proved and it held that the termination of mr. banerjees services could not be said to amount to an act of victimisation or an unfair labour practice.the test always has to be whether the act of the employer is bonafide or not.after giving notice for one month or paying salary for one month in lieu of notice. and normally. an employer may. in a proper case.. be entitled to exercise the said power.similarly. the labour court has accepted the fact that mr. gupta that called for and received mr. banerjees explanation and to that extent it has rejected mr. banerjee suggestion that he had not given any explanation a all but even so. the labour court has not considered the effect of this conclusion on the main controversy between the parties.in our opinion. therefore. the. reasons given by the labour court in support of its conclusion that the discharge of mr. banerjee was not justified are wholly unsatisfactory and so. it has become necessary for us to examine the evidence ourselves.mr. gupta took the view that mr. banerjee was very slow in his work as a salesman. that he was not able to judge the capacity of the dealers and to give them sufficient stocks in time. that he took no steps to put the products of the appellant on prominent view in the dealers shops. that he wag not looking after the pasting of the posters. in fact in one place the poster was pasted upside down. that he was not educating the stockists and dealers as he could have done and that he was reluctant to put hard and intelligent work. itthese defects are specific and it is idle to refuse to give importance to this evidence merely on the ground that no specific instances had been cited.in regard. to the question as to whether the 20 boxes had been opened by mr. banerjee before he made his report. 1.. 1951. 11 l. l j.we do not think that the answers given by mr. gupta in respect of these letters can be of any assistance to the respondents in

the plaint was that the superintendent of police had dismissed him without recording his defence evidence and without giving him an opportunity to produce the same.the suit was opposed on behalf of the punjab government and among others their main defence was that the enquiry was in accordance with the regulations and was not arbitrary.he was consequently reverted to his substantive post of head constable on january 14. 1944.thereafter on january 21. 1944. an enquiry was started against him by the superintendent of police and he was eventually dismissed.shortly before. he was acting as an assistant sub. inspector and actually working as a police censor.the brief facts necessary for present purposes are that the appellant was appointed as a foot. constable in 1931 in the punjab police

conscious that this amendment in the regulations wasthere was an appeal to the district judge by the punjab government.whether the civil courts have jurisdiction to entertain the suit or to go into the question of the validity of the departmental enquiry.three issues. all of a general nature. were framed by the trial court. namely.. whether the plaintiffs dismissal is void. illegal. inoperative and wrongful and what is its effect.the high court pointed out that there was no serious contraven. tion of the regulations and the witnesses who had appeared were cross. examined by the appellant who was also called upon to produce his defence within 48 hours.as to the enquiry. the high court held that though there might have been minor procedural defects in the enquiry it was on the whole substantially in accordance with the regulations and principles of natural justice and could not therefore be held to be invalid.he therefore dismissed the appeal.learned counsel for the appellant

officers of subordinate rank and there was nothing in s. 243 which took away from such officers the protection of s. 240. 3.. 2. even if the police regulations alone applied. there was such violation

subordinate ranks of the various police forces in india shall be such as may be determined by or under the act relating to those forces respectively.as has already been pointed out by the learned district judge. the substance of s. 240. 3. was brought into the police regulations in september 1946 long after the appellant had been dismissed and would therefore not apply to the appellant.nor was

is required for a public purpose.he consider. however. that init should be added that both in the basic assumption that it was the central and not the local government the predecessor of the state government that had effected the transfer. as well as in the further consequence that the exercise of the power under s. 81 of the corporation act was ineffective. the learned judges were aided by concessions accepting the correctness of this position which appear to have been made by the deputy advocate general who represented the state before them.. we shall have occasion to refer to this aspect later.view of our conclusion that the impugned notification fell clearly within the power vested in state government under s. 81 of the jabalpur corporation act. it is not necessary to pronounce upon the correctness of the submissions made to us on the construction of s. i. 1. of that act. there could not be any dispute that if the authority that had transferred the property covered

only to transfers made after the jubbulpore corporation act. 1948 came into force. an untenable contention which has not been persisted in.save in exceptional cases. parties should be held strictly to their pleadings and if owing to discovery of new matter or grounds. there is need to add to or to modify the allegations either in the petition or in the counter. affidavit. the court should insist on formal amendments being effected. for this would enable each party to state its case with precision and definiteness and the other side would have a proper opportunity to know this case and meet it with appropriate defences.if such contention is both not open to the corporation and not tenable on the merits.. it would follow that the impugned notification was fully justified by the. provisions under s. 81 of the jabalpur corporation act.', '1960_72.txt': 'the tribunal has upheld the preliminary objection thus raised by the respondent and held that the reference is invalid.the preliminary objection raised bythe short question of law which falls to be decided in the present appeal is whether a dispute raised by the employees of a general insurance company against their employer for payment of bonus in any particular year can be referred for adjudication by an industrial tribunal under s. 10. 1. of the industrial disputes act. 1947. xiv of 1947..incidentally it has also considered the plea raised under s. 40c and has observed that the said plea is also well founded in the result the tribunal refused to entertain the reference and dismissed it accordingly.it is their case that if the trading profits made by the respondent are ascertained from the respondents balance sheet and the full bench formula is applied. it would appear that the respondent has in its hands a substantial amount of available surplus from which the additional bonus claimed by them can be awarded.this preliminary objection was based on the provisions of s. 31a. 1. and proviso. vii. of the insurance act.must now turn.if the central government decides that no bonus should be paid. no bonus can be paid by the insurer.in other words. bonus claimed by the appellants. if awarded. would. for the purpose of s. 31a. 1.. c.. be a part of their remuneration. and that is precisely what is prohibited by the said provision.bonus intended to be paid to such employees must not exceed in amount the equivalent of their salary for a period which the central government regards as reasonable.proviso. vii. to s. 31a. 1.. c. lays down that nothing in this subsection shall be deemed to prohibit. the payment of bonus in any year on a uniform basis to all salaried employees or any class of them by way of additional remuneration. such bonus. in the case of any employee. not exceeding in amount the equivalent of his salary for a period which. in the opinion of the central government. is reasonable having regard to the circumstances of the case.we are not impressed by this argument.that is why the appellants contend that the enabling provision contained in proviso. vii. should not be construed to constitute a bar against the central governments power to act under s. 10. 1. of the industrial disputes act.in that case all we can say is that there is a lacuna left and the legislature may consider whether it isthen. as to the argument that the government directive issued under proviso. vii. may not be obeyed by any insurer. we do not think that such an event is likely to happen but theoretically it is conceivable that an insurer may refuse to comply with the decision of the government.a. 1..similarly it is urged that the central government may decide that within the maximum prescribed by it. bonus should be paid by an insurer. but the insurer 1000 may not comply with the central governments decision and in that case the only way to make the central governments decision effective is to refer the matter to adjudication and enable the employees to obtain an award which can be executed.that is why we think that the tribunal was right in coming to the conclusion that the reference made by the central government is invalid.be kept within the discretion of the central government so far as the payment of bonus by the insurers is concerned.in the absence of the said provision no bonus could have been claimed by insurance employees. and so the effect of the said provision must be to limit the said right to the conditions prescribed by it.then. as to the argument that the government directive issued under proviso. vii. may not be obeyed by any insurer. we do not think that such an event is likely to happen but theoretically it is conceivable that an insurer may refuse to comply with the decision of the government.in that case the court had to consider the effect of s. 10 of the banking companies act. 1949. prior to its amendment in 1956.', '1961_363.txt': 'the judgment of the court was delivered by shah.j.. ballygunge real property and building society

by suppression of material facts and that. in any event. the order made without notice to the appellant was vexatious and oppressive and amounted to an abuse of the process of court.records and

the order having been initially pass ex parte an application for discharging or modifying the order was in law maintainable at the instance of the appellant but the order in so far as it directed the appellant who was a director of the company to appear before the court to be examined touching upon the affairs of the company was. in the circumstances of the case. desirable and necessary. and that the statement of the official liquidator on which the order dated january 18. 1960. was issued not being an affidavitmr. justice law rejected the application filed by the appellant. holding that the order dated january 18. 1960. was final and that he had no power to review. modify. alter or vary the same. that the order merely summoning for examination under s. 477 of the companies act did not affect a partys rights. there being no charge. no complaint and no allegation against him.the learned judges modified the order in so far as it directed production of the books of account relating to the ballygunge estate. private. ltd. and the ballygunge building society private ltd.. because those companies were not parties to the liquidation proceedings.was not required by the companies. court.

or to prevent abuse of the process of court. and a direction to vacate an order previously made. is in a proper case within the courts inherent jurisdiction.the judge may. if he things fit. either in the order for examination or by any subsequent order. give directions to the specific matters on which such person is to be examined.that is an inquisitorial power. which may work with great severity against third persons. and it seems to me to be obvious that such a section ought to be used with the greatest care.the english companies act. 1948. 11 12 geo vi c. 88. on the question relating to examination of officers of the company or other persons are substantially the same as s. 477 of the indians companies act. 1956. and the principles laid down by the superior courts in england. which have been assimilated in the practice of company winding up by the courts in india are useful in determining the nature of the proceeding.the secretary refused to answer certain questions relating to the matters in issue in the action and the court held that the liquidator had shown no reason for seeking discovery except to assist him in the action and so to evade the order of the judge postponing discovery in the action and therefore the witness was justified in refusing to answer the question.it is a power of an inquisitorial kind which enables the court to direct to be examined. not merely before itself. but before the examiner appointed by the court. some third person who is no party to a litigation.in our view. the high court was right in holding that in a proper case it would be open to the company judge to vacate an ex. parte order obtained under r. 243 of the companies. court. rules.where it is satisfied that the order is vexatious. or oppressive. or where other adequate grounds exist to discharge the same.the court in that case held that the action of the liquidator was vexatious.it was held that the liquidator must satisfy the court that it would be just and beneficial for the purposes of the winding up.the liquidator who had brought an action on behalf of the company against an officer exhibited interrogatories which had been fully answered by the defendant. and thereafter. the liquidator sought an order from the court to examine the defendant under s. 115 of the companies act. 1862.so as not unnecessarily put in motion the machinery of justice when it is not wanted or to put it in motion at a stage when it is not clear that it is wanted. and certainly not to put it is motion if unnecessary mischief is going to be done or hardship inflicted upon the third person who is called upon to appear and give information.the plea of the appellant that compelling him to submit to examination without permitting him to have access to the books before answering questions put to him is oppressive has no substance.it appears also that mr. justice mitter was satisfied on the statement filed by the official liquidator that the appellant had the custody of certain important books of the company.counsel for the appellant submitted that the order for examination must be made after considering all the facts and circumstances of the case and that there was nothing on the record to show that the facts and circumstances were considered by mr. justice mitter before he made the order for examination.the high court. in appeal. expressed the view that on the merits there was no ground for interference and it was satisfied that it was desirable and necessary that the appellant as a director should be examined.the appellant has admitted in his affidavit that he was served with a copy of the order. but he has not chosen to produce it in the court of first instance. nor is the order printed in the record prepared for the use of the court in this appeal.the court has made the order in exercise of the jurisdiction vested in it and in the absence of any material to show that the order was made for a collateral purpose or by the misleading the court. the appellant is not entitled to have the order vacated.this court cannot proceed upon an assumption that the order for examination of a person who has ceased to be a director prior to the date of the winding up must necessarily be regarded as oppressive or vexatious.after considering all the facts and circumstances of the case and that there was nothing on the record to show that the facts and circumstances were considered by mr. justice mitter before he made the order for examination.in the circumstances.a director of a company. past or present. is ordinarily in a position to give useful information about the affairs of the company in winding up.if the appellant is not entitled to inspection of the statement he would certainly. for the same reason. not be entitled to a copy of that statement.of the calcutta high court. prior to the promulgation of the companies. court. rules. was different.under r. 195 an application for examination of a person under s 195 of the indian companies act 1913. could be made ex parte to the judge but it had to be by petition verified by the official liquidator stating the facts upon which the application was based.there is however. no warrant for the view that the petition and the statement form part of the same document.', '1962_47.txt': '. 1. we do not agree with these contentions.. the mortgage continued to subsist till the date

had withdrawn his candidature subsequently.the petitioner contended that baijnath was neither a necessary nor a proper party and that in any event the non. joinder of a party. wason the finding. however. that baijnath was a proper party to be impleaded in the case. the tribunal directed that he added as a respondent in the petition and notice of the petition be served on him.the petitioner contended that baijnath was neither a necessary nor a proper party and that in any event the non. joinder of a party.this petition was summarily rejected by the high court on the 27th november. 1952.in the view of the tribunal baijnath was not a necessary party in the sense that in his absence no effective decision could be given in the case and that being a proper party. there was no obstacle to his being joined as a respondent even after the expiry of the period of limitation prescribed for making the petition.none of these propositions however have any application if the special law itself confers authority on a tribunal to proceed with a petition in accordance with certain procedure and when it does not state the consequences of non. compliance with certain procedural requirements laid down by it.it is also well settled that it is a sound principle of natural justice that the success of a candidate who has won at an election should not be lightly interfered with and any petition seeking such interference must strictly conform to the requirements of the law.in cases where the election law does not prescribe the consequenceit is always to be borne in mind that though the election of a successful candidate is not to be lightly interfered with. one of the essentials of that law is also to safeguard the purity of the election process and also to see that people do not get elected by flagrant breaches of that law or by corrupt practices.section 83 states that an election petition shall contain a concise statement of the material facts on which the petitioner relies and shall be signed by the petitioner and verified in the manner laid down in the code of civil procedure for the verification of pleadings.it further provides that the petition shall be accompanied by a list signed and verified in like manner setting forth full particulars of any corrupt or illegal practice which the petitioner alleges.section 80 provides that no election on shall be called in question except by an election petition presented in accordance with the provisions of this part.it is always to be borne in mind that though the election of a successful candidate is not to be lightly interfered with. one of the essentials of that law is also to safeguard the purity of the election process and also to see that people do not get elected by flagrant breaches of that law or by corrupt practices.in that case the question arose whether the petition was duly verified and whether it was accompanied by all the necessary lists required by section 83. 2..as regards parties actually on record.as regards the dictum of the lucknow tribunal that no inquiry is required to be made in the case of non. compliance with the provisions of sections 81. 83 and 117 but that an inquiry would be necessary to determine whether certain parties were nominated candidates or not. in our opinion it cannot stand scrutiny.an elaborate inquiry had to be conducted to determine the point whether the petition was typed on blank paper signed by the petitioner or whether it was signed by him or some person authorized on his behalf after it had been typed.whether a petition has been presented by a person who has purported to sign it or by someone else or whether an agent who has signed the petition is a duly authorized agent or not are its much matters of inquiry as the question of determination of the names of nominated candidates.the member of the tribunal who dissented from the majority view gave cogent and sound reasons for holding that non. joinder of a duly nominated candidate who has withdrawn was not necessarily fatal to the petition.113 of 1952. decided on 28th july. 1953. the majority of the bombay tribunal. decided otherwise.in another case. petition no.the

an occupant may. by giving written notice to the mamlatdar or mahalkari. relinquish his occupancy. either absolutely or in favour of a specified person provided that such relinquishment applied to the entire occupancy or to whole survey numbers. or recognized shares of survey numbers.this case being thus out of the way. learned advocate for the appellants urges that under s. 74 of the bombay land revenue code. as shiddappa was the registered occupant. the rajinama filed by him operated upon the entire occupancy and amounted to a relinquishment of the rights of both the brothers shiddappa and annappa.we are unable to accept this argument as correct.the concluding paragraph of the section clearly recognises that a relinquishment may be in favour of more persons than one.from time to time prescribed in this behalf for each district by the governor in council.this is for facilitating the purpose of the code but it does not mean that the other persons in whose favour the occupancy is relinquished cease to have any right.it is true that the principal one of such persons must enter into a written agreement to become the registered occupant..in lalchand sakharam marwadi v. khendu

could pass only the right. title and interest of rashmoni and could not affect the reversionary rights of the plaintiffs.on the first point both the courts below have held concurrently. that there was absolutely no legal necessity which justified the execution of the security bond by rashmoni in favour of suhasini.3 on the other and this dispute centered.the contentions. though somewhat plausible at first sight. seem to us to be wholly without substance.on the first point both the courts below have held concurrently. that there was absolutely no legal necessity which justified the execution of the security bond by rashmoni in favour of suhasini.it may be. that it was notthe execution of the security bond therefore was an act beneficial to the estate of haripada.in the first place the money borrowed by mohini or deposited by him in court did not and could not benefit haripadas estate at all.it is said that this was not a mere moral obligation but a legal liability on the part of the lady. as mohini could have claimed contribution from her to the extent that haripadas estate was benefited by the deposit.the high court has rightly pointed out that rashmoni did not execute the bond to raise any money to pay off her share of the deposit and in fact no necessity for raising money for that purpose at all existed at that time.even if the release of the estate was considered to be desirable. that had been already accomplished by mohini who borrowed money on his own responsibility.the utmost that could be said was that rashmoni was bound to reimburse mohini to the extent that the deposit of money by mohini had benefited the estate of haripada.20. 950 only were required to be deposited in court.but the most important thing that would require consideration is the state of things actually existing at the time when the security bond was executed.the second point urged by mr. chatterjee raises the question as to whether the fact of mohinis joining his mother in executing the security bond would make the transaction binding on the actual reversioner. mohini being admittedly the presumptive reversioner of haripada at the date of the transaction.but by no stretch of imagination could it be regarded as a prudent act on the part of a hindu female heir which was necessary for the protection of the estate of the last male holder.money by mohini had benefited the estate of haripada.the high court has rightly pointed out that rashmoni did not execute the bond to raise any money to pay off her share of the deposit and in fact no necessity for raising money for that purpose at all existed at that time.but this.mr. chatterjee placed considerable reliance upon another document which purports to be a deed of declaration and was executed by ram narayan on the 5th of october. 1918.protection of the estate of the last male holder.this deed purports to be addressed to bangshidari ghosh and keshav dutt. two other alienees of the properties of mohini and haripada and does not amount to a representation made to the auction purchaser annada prasad ghose or to the father of the present appellants.mohini being the immediate reversioner who joined in the execution of the security bond must be deemed to have consented to the transaction.this contention of the appellant must therefore fail.the third and the last contention raised by mr. chatterjee is that in any event his client is aas the sons of ram narayan claim as heirs of haripada and not of their father. the admissions. if any. made by the latter could not in any way bind them.1.this proposition. their lordships observed. was opposed both to principle and authority. it being a settled doctrine of hindu law that nobody has a vested right so long as the widow is alive and the eventual reversioner does not claim through anyone who went before him.72. 84.approved of by the judicial committee in gounden v. gounden. 46 i. a.this contention of the appellant must therefore fail.72 at 83. 84.vide the collector of masaulipatam v. cavaly venkata. m. i. a.u law that nobody has a vested right so long as the widow is alive and the eventual reversioner does not claim through anyone who went before him.in our opinion the contention formulated in this form really involves a misconception of the legal position of an alienee of a hindu widows property.the interest of a hindu widow in the pro. perties inherited by her bears no analogy or resemblance to what may be described as an equitable estate in english law and which cannot be followed in the hands of a bonafide purchaser for value without notice.in our opinion the view taken by the high court is quite proper.whatever enquiries the appellants may have made. 1. 6 m. i. a. would be of no avail to them when the alienation is not binding on the whole estate but only on the womans estate of rashmoni.the subsequent transferee could not claim to have acquired any higher right than what his predecessor had and it is immaterial whether he bona fide paid the purchase money or took proper legal advice.in this case the alienation was by way of mortgage.there is no necessity in fact or if the alienee could not prove that he made bona fide enquiries and was satisfied about its existence. the transfer is undoubtedly not void but the transferee would get only the widows estate in the property which does not affect in any way the interest of the reversioner.', '1951_40.txt': 'in our opinion. the contention raised by the learned attorney. general is sound.the high court was in error in engrafting a proviso

continuously and exclusively kept concubine by name raj dulari. who had passed into the coneubinage of raja ajit singh after the death of her husband. 3. as the illegitimate son of raja ajit singh.

putative father. inherited a moiety of the estate which was held by the widows during their lifetime.but. if he be docile. he receives a simple maintenance.the answer to the question depends upon the content of the right of an illegitimate son to succeed to the self. acquired property of his putative father.no mention of a widow is found in the above verses. but inhowever. should there be no sons of a wedded wife. the son of the female slave takes the whole estate. provided there be no daughters of a wife. nor sons of daughters.the other half share got by the widow. after the succession opened out to his putative father on the death of the said widow..but the language there is very distinct. that if the father be dead the bre. thren should make him partaker of the moiety of a share.on that interpretation. he accepted the view of the bombay high court and held that an illegitimate son and a legitimate son. being members of an undivided hindu family governed by mitakshara. the illegitimate son becomes entitled to the whole of the immoveable property of the family if the legitimate son dies without any male issue.but. if he be docile. he receives a simple maintenance.but. if there be such the son of the female slave participates for half a share only.on the death of the legitimate son. who had succeeded to the raja. it was held that the illegitimate son succeeded to him

father was joint.. 2.. 1922. l. r.in dealing with the question of status of an illegitimate son. sir dinshah mulla. speaking for the court. after considering the relevant hindu law texts and decisions. arrived at the following conclusion at p. 15 on a consideration of the texts and the cases on the subject their lordships are of opinion that the illegitimate son of a sudra by a continuous concubine has the status of a son. and that he is a member of the family that the share of inheritance given to him is not merely in lieu of maintenance. but in recognition of his status as a son it is not necessary to multiply decisions.sir lawrence jenkins observed at p. 37 thus here the contest is between the illegitimate son and the widow. and though the widow is not named in the text it is well settled that as a preferential heir to the daughters son she is included among those who share with the illegitimate son. and it would serve no useful purpose to speculate why she was not mentioned in the text.when the succession opens. in a competition between an illegitimate son and other reversioners. the illegitimate son is certainly a nearer heir to the last male holder than the other reversioners.1. only such share as his father may give him.the cases on the subject their lordships are of opinion that the illegitimate son of a sudra by a continuous concubine has the status of a son. and that he is a member of the family that the share of inheritance given to him is not merely in lieu of maintenance. but in recognition of his status as a son it is not necessary to multiply decisions.but his rights are limited compared to those of a son born in wedlock.as on the death of the widow the estate reverts back to the last malehindu law texts. has the status of a son and is heir to the self. acquired property of his putative father.we regret our inability to accept this proposition.becomes entitled to possession.for. if accepted. we would be speaking in two voices.but a reference to that judgment shows that no such proposition has been laid down therein.this decision cannot. therefore. be invoked in support of the contention that in a case where the doctrine of reverter applies the illegitimate son is excluded from succession.on the other hand. the nagpur high court in bhagwantrao v. punjaram. 1. rightly came to the conclusion that where on a partition between a legitimate and an illegitimate son. the widow was allotted a share. on her death the illegitimate son was entitled to a share in the property.decision of the madras high court in karuppayee ammal v. ramaswami. 1..the reason for that conclusion is found at p. 868 and it is the principle underlying the doctrine of reverter referred to is that the last male. holders estate is inherited by females who have no free right of alienation and who hold a peculiar kind of estate called womans estate and on whose death the then heir of the last male. holder succeeds to the last male. holders estate.but a reference to that judgment shows that no such proposition has been laid down therein.55 mad.it is.next contended that the widows acquired an absolute interest in the estate of raja.assuming that learned counsel for the appellant was correct in his contention. we fail to see how the said legal position would advance the appellants case. for the court of wards admittedly managed only the i. l. r.the illegitimate son is excluded from succession.255. widows limited estate and it is not the case of the appellant that the court of wards acquired on behalf of the widows an

2.we will first take up the appeal of a 1.the high court has confirmed the conviction and sentence of a 1 passed by the trial court.aggrieved by the order of conviction and sentence passed by the trial court the accused persons had filed appeals before the high court.the trial court placing reliance on the evidence of pw 6 has convicted and sentenced the accused persons under section 302 read with section 34 of the ipc to suffer imprisonment for life and to pay a fine of rs1000 each and in default to undergo simple imprisonment for a further period of six months.however the high court has acquitted a 2 only on the ground that a 2 had not actively participated in the commission of the offence and therefore the trial court was not justified in convicting a 2 for an offence punishable under section 302 read with section 34 of the ipc.in order to satisfy ourselves we have once again carefully analyzed the evidence on record and the conviction of a 1 by the trial court with the aid of the sole eye witness of pw 6.while considering the appeal filed by the state of rajasthan we have carefully perused the judgment and order passed by the high court.it is thus an exception to the general rule of criminal jurisprudence that it is the primary responsibility of the person who actually commits a crime and only that person can be held guilty andthe high court has acquitted a 2 only on the ground that merely sitting on the chest of the deceased rules out the possibility of active participation by a 2 in the commission of offence and therefore has acquitted him from the charges under section 302 read with section 34 of the ipc.section 34 of ipc enacts that when a criminal act is done by several persons in furtherance of the common intention of all each of such persons is liable for that act in the same manner as if it were done by him alone.the essence of that liability is found in the existence of common intention animating the accused leading to the doing of a criminal act in furtherance of such intention.the section is intended to meet a case in which it is difficult to distinguish between the act of individual members of a party and to prove exactly what part was played by each of them.15.a perusal of section 34 of the ipc would clearly indicate that there must be two ingredients for convicting a person with the aid of section 34 of the ipc.it is thus clear that the criminal act referred to in section 34 ipc is the result of the concerted action of more than one person if the said result was reached in furtherance of the common intention and each person must be held liable for the ultimate result as if he had done it himself.firstly there must be a common intention and secondly there must be participation by the accused persons in furtherance of the common intention.it has come in the evidence of pw 6 that a 1 was assaulting the deceased with stones and a 2 was sitting on the chest of the deceased.on the said date of incident the animosity culminated to an assault on the deceased by the accused persons when the deceased was nearing his land.a 1 and a 2 had a common intention to assault and kill the deceased person with a 2 as a participant in the crime with the intention of lending weight to the commission of an offence pursuant to a pre concerted plan.actually committing the planned crime.', '1954_0.txt': 'there is no

'1952_42.txt': 'the first and the main objection to the validity of the act taken by the learned counsel is that the bill was never passed into law.as already indicated. this objection is founded on the omission from the proceedings of the madhya pradesh legislative assembly dated the 5th april. 1950. of a statement to the effect that the bill was put to the house by the speaker and was passed by it.34. 1. votes may be taken by voices or division and shall be taken by division if any member so desires.the speaker shall determine the method of taking votes by division.the result of a division shall be announced by the speaker and shall not be challenged.115. 1. the secretary shall cause to be prepared a full report of the proceedings of the assembly at each of its meetings and publish it as soon as practicable.one impression of this printed report shall be submitted to the speaker for his confirmation and signature and when signed shall constitute the authentic record of the proceedings of the assembly.in my opinion the contention raised that the bill was not passed into law fails and must be rejected.there are no grounds whatever for doubting the correctness of his certificate.the governor under that article could assent to a bill or could reserve it for the consideration of the president at his optionthe legislature of madhya pradesh consists of the governor and the legislative assembly.it was said that even if there was no open opposition to the passing of the bill. it was possible that if it was put to the assembly. it might have rejected it.the certificate of the speaker is conclusive on the point that the bill was passed by the legislature. vide craies statute law. 4th edn.. p. 36..this argument. in my opinion. has not much force having regard to the terms and scope of article 200.in my opinion. the argument is fallacious..the president having given his assent. the bill must be held to have been passed into law.the governor being empowered to reserve the bill for the consideration of the president and this having been done. it was for the president either to assent to the bill or to withhold his assent.in my opinion. the argument is fallacious.this contention fails for the reasons given in my judgment in the bihar case.next it was contended that the obligation to pay compensation was implicit in the legislative power contained in entry 36 of list ii and that the act was unconstitutional as it had provided for acquisition of zamindaris without payment of compensation. the provisions relating to it being illusory.the provisions of article 31. 4. support the view of the learned attorney. general that what has to be sent to the president is the bill as passed by the legislature and not the bill after it has been assented to by the governor.it would be a meaningless formality for the president to give his assent to the same bill twice over.this word has not the same meaning in all the articles.the contention that there is no public purpose behind the impugned act has also to be repelled on the same reasoning as given by me in the bihar case.the next argument of mr. somayya that the act is a fraud on the constitution in that in legislating under entry 42 of list iii. it has legislated for non. payment of compensation has also to be repelled. for the reasons given in the bihar case.it is too late in the day to contend that reform in this directions is not for general public benefit.the conditions for the application of article 31. 4. thus stand fulfilled.besides the obstacle of article 31. 4..this bill was pending at the commencement of the constitution. it was reserved for the consideration of the president and the president gave his assent to it..the argument that the act is bad inasmuch as it delegates essential legislative power to the executive is negatived for the reasons given in the bihar case.the contention that those eighty mahals are not an estateand are thus excluded from the reach of article 31. a does not. howeverthe assessment of value by the petitioner cannot be taken at its full value.it cannot at any rate be held that legislation which provides for the payment of a sum of rs.there is nothing on the record to support this contention.very much advances the petitioners case. because the hurdles created in his way by articles 31. b and 31. 4. stand

certain acts mentioned in the schedule despite the provisions of article 31. a and is not illustrative of article 31a but stands independent of it.this petition is accordingly dismissed but in the circumstances i make no order as to costs.lastly. it was urged that the legislation in question was not enacted bona fide inasmuch as in 1946 the legislature having passedra. who appeared for the petitioner placed reliance on the observations of holmes c. j.the dictum of holmes c. j.iii. p. 541.the passage. however read in its entirety. negatives the contention.mr. bindra merely tried to annotate the arguments of mr. das but with no better result.it was said that right to compensation is implied in entry 36 list ii of the seventh schedule and that article 31. 2. does not confer the right but merely protects it.the petition is therefore dismissed.iii. p. 541.the passage. however read in its entirety. negatives the contention.it was contended that by the terms of the covenant of merger those properties were declared as the petitioners private properties and were protected from state legislation by the guarantee given in article 362 of the constitution and hence the impugned act was bad as it contravened the provisions of this article.it may be mentioned that under powers of compulsory acquisition a number of properties have been nationalized in england and other countries.the constitution had not even come into force by the time that most of these statutes were enacted.the properties belonging to the petitioner and acquired under the statute were originally situate in an indian state which became subsequently merged with madhya pradesh.there is no evidence whatsoever that all these enactments were enacted with a fraudulent design of defeating the provisions of payment of compensation contained in the constitution.this petition is accordingly dismissed but there will be no order of costs.for the reasons given inmoreover it seems to me that in view of the comprehensive language of article 363 this issue is not justiciable.237 is a malguzar of eighteen villages but owns no estate.the guarantee has no greater scope than this.sanads etc.283. 284 and 285 are ilakadars and in petitions nos.the guarantee contained in the articles is of a limited extent only.seven of these are by zamindars from madhya pradesh who are owners of estates.it assures that the rules properties declared as their private properties will not be claimed as state properties.petitioner in petition no.in my opinion. the argument is based on a fallacy.this petition also fails and is dismissed.mukherjea. j. i agree with my lord the chief justice that these petitions should be dismissed.there will be no order as to costs.as already stated. the purpose of the act is to bring about reforms in the land tenure system of the state by establishing direct contact between the tillers of the soil and the government.for the reasons given therein this petition is also dismissed. but i make no order as to costs in it.the madhya pradesh abolition of proprietary rights. estates. mahals. alienated lands. act 1950. act i of 1951. having on january 22. 1951.. received

court. b. p. sinha c. j.and mangalmurthi and mudholkar jj..it may be mentioned here that the states of bihar and uttar pradesh also passed legislation for the abolition of zamindar in their receptive states and the validity of those legislations was also contested by the proprietors affected thereby.the legal validity of the constitution. first amendment. act. 1951. which was challenged. has however. been upheld by this court andmr. b. somayya appearing for the petitioner in petition no.articles 31. a relates back to the constitution and article 31. b to the respective dates of the acts and regulations specified in the ninth schedule.the present bunch of petitions has been filed in this court under article 32 of the constitutional challenged the validity of the madhya pradesh act and praying for appropriate writs. directions and orders restraining the state of madhya pradesh from acting under that act and disturbing the petition title to. and possession of their respective estates. villages or properties.there is no dispute as to the correctness of the dates given to us by counsel for the petitioners.the speaker then read out the motion.the next of the bill as it emerged through. the house was printed on 29th april. 1950. and speaker signed a copy of the printedit was referred to a select committee on 15th october 1949.the select committee made its report on 9th march. 1950. which was presented to the assembly on 29th march. 1950.the assembly considered the bill in the light of the report between that date and 5th april 1950. during which period the amendments proposed by the selected committee were moved and disposed of.shows that the house accepted the bill.there is no evidence on affidavit by anybody who wasthere being a presumption of regularity attached to all official business the onus is undoubtedly on the petitioners to allege and prove that the procedure prescribed by the rules was not followed.it only shows that the house passed on to discuss another bill. namely the madhya pradesh state aid to industries. amendment. bill. 1950.the objection formulated by learned counsel for the petitioners is founded is founded on the rules of procedure framed by the assembly under section 84 of the government of india act. 1953 which were continued in force until new rules were farmed under article 208 of the constitution.what is contended is that the provisions of old rule 20. 1. have not been followed.the petitioners rely only on the absence in the official report of proceedings of any mention of the question being put to or carried by the assembly.a member.i have already pointed out that the original printed act produced before us clearly shows that on 5th may 1950. the speaker certified that the bill had been passed by the assembly.this does not appear to me to be a correct approach to the problem.it is urged that the question that the bill be passed into law was not to the assembly under rule 20 and if it was at all put the result of the voting. whether by voices or division. was never announced by the speaker as required by old rule 34.the certification of the speaker was within a month from 5th april 1950. while the confirmation of the proceedings took place on 1st october. 1950.appear to me to be a correct approach to the problem.i am not impressed by the argument founded on the fine distinction sought to be made between an irregularity of procedure and on omission to take a particular step in the procedure.further the speeches delivered by the eleven speakers clearly indicate that the stage there was no opposition the bill.the petitioners as i have said. strongly rely on the official report of the proceedings.the question before us is whether as a matter of fact the bill had duly passed according to the rules.the certification of the speaker was within a month from 5th april 1950. while the confirmation of the proceedings took place on 1st october. 1950.bunch of reports of proceedings.re.i am unable to accept this line of reasoning.. cannot be given any legal validity and the argument founded on authentication under defunct rule 115. 2. must lose all its force.validity of the act is not well. founded and must be rejected.finally. the irregularity of procedure. if any. is expressly cured by article 212.i am not impressed by the argument founded on the fine distinction sought to be made between an irregularity of procedure and on omission to take a particular step in the procedure.under that article. the governor can do one of three things. namely he may declare that he assentssuch an omission in my opinion is nothing more than an irregularity of procedure.the whole arguments is built on the word law.in the latter event happening. the argument of the learned counsel for the petitioners will require that what has become a law by the assent of the president will. in order to be effective. have to be again reserved for the consideration of the president. a curious conclusion i should be loath to reach unless i am compelled to do so.for one thing. it assumes that a bill passed by the state assembly can become a law only by the assent of the governor.i do not think that what is referred to as law in article 31. 3. is necessarily hat had already become a law before receiving the assent of the president.the question whether the requirements of article 31. 3. have been complied with will arise only when the state purports to acquire the property of any person under a law and thatthe procedure to be followed after a bill is passed by the state assembly is laid down in article 200.in my opinion there is no substance in the second objection which must. therefore. be over ruled.mr. n. s. bindra and mr. swami have sought to reinforce those argument by citing certain further passager from certain text books and reported decisions.the words has received his assent clearly imply and point to an accomplished fact and the clause read as a whole does not grammatically exclude a law that eventually become a law by having had received the assent to the president.thus it is open to the petitioners to show that the legislature had no power to enact the law or that it offends against any other provision of the constitution.the provisions of the impugned act have been analysed and summarised by mahajan j. in the judgmentin other words. the word law has been used to mean what at the time of dispute purpose to be or is asserted to be a law.thus it is open to the petitioners to show that the legislature had no power to enact the law or that it offends against any other provision of the constitution.in any event the act cannot. for reasons stated by me in my judgment in the bihar appeals. be questioned on the ground of absence of public purpose or of compensation.of the gross income.further the compensation provided in the madhya pradesh act is more liberal than that provided in the bihar act. for under clause 4. 2. of schedule i the net income can in no case be reduced to less than 5 per cent.it can. nevertheless. be challenged on other grounds.re. g. the last ground of attack is that the 80 malaguzari mahals belonging to the petitioner in petition no.referred to above may well have been conceived and undertaken from time to time in utmost good faith.further under section 10 the state government is bound to direct payment of an interim compensation amounting to one. tenth of the estimated amount of compensation if the whole amount is not paid within a period of six months from the date of vesting of the property in the state.learned advocate. general of madhya pradesh concedes that these malguzari mahals are not estates within the meaning of the c. p. land revenue act but contends that the word estate has been used in a larger sense in article 31. a.i do not think it necessary to discuss the meaning of the word estate as used in article 31. a for in my opinion. the argument of the learned advocate. general founded on article 31. b is well. founded and ought to prevail.a question was raised by mr. asthana appearing for the ruler of khairagarh who is the petitioner in petition no.mr. b. somayya has drawn our attention to the words without prejudice to the generality of the provisions of article 31. a occurring in the beginning of article 31. b and contended that the interpretation put upon these words by the judicial committee in shibnath banerjees case.. 1945. l. r.opinion. the argument of the learned advocate. general founded on article 31. b is well. founded and ought to prevail.further this article does not import any legal obligation but is an assurance only.the words referred to were used obviously to prevent any possible argument that article 30. b cut down the scope or ambit of the general words used in article 31. a.72 i. a.khairagarh is one of the states which formerly fell within the eastern states agency.all that the covenant does is to recognise the title of the ruler as owner of certain properties.finally. the jurisdiction of the court to decide any dispute arising out of the covenant is barred by article 363.all that the covenant does is to recognise the title of the ruler as owner of certain properties.', '1959_26.txt': 'we agree with the view submitted by the appellants.the tribunal in its supplementary statement found that the course

complainant to adduce the evidence of a handwriting expert in order to establish the genuineness of the questioned document.if it were not a case between a lawyer as an accused and his client as the complainant. perhaps the high court may not have taken the unusual course of giving a fresh opportunity to the complainant to have second round of litigation. to the great prejudice of the accused.that was a very important piece of evidence. which if genuine could go a long way to prove the case against the appellant.in one sense that comment was justified but in a case of this kind between lawyer and client we think the matter cannot be left. where it is.according to the prosecution it clearly showed the respondents connection with the sum of rs.5000... the subject matter of the charge.it is true that expert evidence cannot always be a final settler still in a call of this kind. it is eminently desirable that the court should be assisted by a qualified expert since almost the

accused person should not be placed on trial for the same offence more than once. except in very exceptional circumstances.high court. in our judgment. entirely misdirected itself in setting aside the order of acquittal and making an order for a fresh trial by another magistrate. simply on the ground that the case was between a lawyer and his client.the fact that the appellant is a practising

to be taxed provided they are within the state of bombay. and the rulemaking authority is not restricted to taxation which is constitutionally permissible.on the question of severability. i cannot see how the good can be separated from the bad in this case even if the explanation to section 2. 14. be expunged unless the constitution be read as part of the act and we are to read into the act some such provision as follows notwithstanding anything which is said in any part of this act. all sales which the state is prohibited to tax under the constitution are excluded from the scope of this act.see badische aniline und soda fabrick v. basle chemical works. bind schedler. 1. and badische aniline und soda fabrick v. hickson. 2. the situs or location of the sale or purchase therefore assumed an importance under article 286 and the constitution makers had before them not only the legislative practice prevailing in the various states before the constitution but also the concept of sale as defined in the indian sale of goods act.. 2. 1906 a. conce the transfer of ownership or the passing of the property in the goods was accepted as the sole criterion of taxability it was not necessary at all to define what was a sale or purchase which took place 1117 inside the state.besides this ingredient there were various other ingredients which had been similarly considered sufficient territorial connections and to consider that the ingredient of the passing of property in the goods was the only ingredient which was considered important to be mentioned in the non. obstante clause is to ignore the facts and do violence to the whole conception underlying the incorporation of the non. obstante clause in the explanation.that does not however mean that it is only the delivery state which will be entitled to tax the sale or purchase.it would be a more natural way of reading the non. obstante clause to read into it an intention to state what according to the constitution makers was the basic idea of fixing the situs or the location of the sale or purchase in the place where the transfer of ownership took place or the property in the goods passed and to indicate that notwithstanding that fact a sale or purchase which fell within the category mentioned in the explanation was none. the. less to be deemed to have taken place inside the delivery state.under the general law relating to the sale of goods the property in the goods having by reason of such sale or purchase passed in another state that state will no doubt be entitled to tax the sale or purchase as having taken place inside the state.the object of article 286 is to impose restrictions on the imposition of tax on sale or purchase of goods and the only restriction which has been imposed in connection with the sales or purchases which take place in this manner is that a state shall not impose a tax on the sale or purchase of goods where such sale or purchase takes place outside the state.in order to arrive at a conclusion whether the object and purpose of the explanation was to enable the delivery state to tax such sales or purchases either in addition to the state in which the property in the goods had passed or in substitution thereof one has got to bear in mind the basic idea that a state would normally be entitled to tax a sale or purchase where such sale or purchase took place inside the state except in cases covered by article 286. 1.. b. and article 286. 2..it is no doubt true that in the explanation the word only has not been used nor has the word also been used and we have to gather the purpose of the enactment of the explanation from the words of the explanation itself.according to the position as discussed above both the states would thus be entitled to tax such sales or purchases.where such sale or purchase took place inside the state except in cases covered by article 286. 1.. b. and article 286. 2..that sale or purchase has to be one as a direct result of which the goods have actually been delivered in the delivery state for the purpose of consumption in that state.if this position is borne in mind it is clear that not only would the state in which the property in the goods passed continue to be entitled to tax the sale or purchase because of such sale or purchase having taken place inside the state. but the delivery state would also be entitled to tax such sale or purchase by reason of the operation of the legal fiction in so far as the goods have actually been delivered as a direct result of such sale or purchase in the delivery state for the. purpose of consumption in that state.as a matter of physical fact it is in the book case a.before i proceed to discuss the effect of article 286. 2. on the taxing powers of both the states it is necessary to consider what is the exact type of sale or purchase which is covered by the explanation.the word consumption has been thus defined in websters new international dictionary. vol. 1. page 483. consumption... 3. economics. the use of. economic. goods resulting in the diminution or destruction of their utilities opposed to production.generally. it may be said that consumption means using things. and production means adapting them for use.it is only a transaction of sale or purchase directly results in the delivery of goods 1123 for the purpose of consumption in the delivery state that comes within the category of transactions covered by the explanation.econ.according to the position as discussed above both the states would thus be entitled to tax such sales or purchases.we have however got to take count of article 286. 2..in my opinion they have reference only to immediate consumption within the state and no further.econ.the transaction of. such sale or purchase even though it be as between a dealer in the one state and the consumer in the delivery state is nonetheless a transaction in the course of inter. state trade or commerce.if the matters stood thus and there was no further provision to be considered the position would be that in a transaction of sale or purchase covered by the explanation construed as above both the state in which the property in the goods passed and the delivery state would be entitled to tax such sale or purchase. the former by reason of the property in the goods having passed inside that state and the latter by reason of the goods having been delivered as a direct result of such sale or purchase for the purpose of consumption in that state.whether a transaction of sale or purchase takes place between a dealer on the one hand and a dealer on the other or between a dealer on the one hand and a consumer on the other in theother.. beal on the cardinal rules of legal interpretation. 3rd

at p. 205 maxwell on the interpretation of statutes 9th edition.it therefore follows that the general provision which is enacted in article 286. 2. against the imposition of tax on the sale or purchase of goods in the course of inter. state trade or commerce should give way to the special provision which is enacted in the explanation to article 286. 1.. a. enabling the delivery state to tax

state is concerned.i would therefore base my. construction of the explanation to article 286. 1.. a. and article 286. 2. on the rule as to the interpretation of statutes which. 1828. 5 bing. 177 at p.

acquiring an intrastate character so far as the delivery state is concerned.i agree that the bombay sales tax act. 1952. and the rules made. thereunder except rule 5. 2.. 1. do not contravene the provisions of article 286. that rule 5. 2.. 1. is clearly severable and can be ignored. that there is no substance in the contention of shri seervai that there is a violation of the fundamental rights guaranteed under article 14 and that the taxation statutes should be construed in a manner so as to allow the statute itself to stand. the taxing authority being prevented by injunction from imposing the tax on subjects excluded by the constitution from the purview of taxation by the state.such transaction would be a transaction of sale or purchase where as a direct result of such sale or purchase the goods are delivered in the delivery state for the purpose of consumption in that state i. e.. where the transaction is between a dealer in the state in which the property in the goods passes and a consumer in the delivery state.i have referred to above. lifting the transaction of sale or purchase covered by the explanation to article 286. 1.. a. out of the category of the transactions in the course of inter. state trade or commerce and assimilating it to 1128 a transaction of sale or purchase which takes place inside the delivery state thus investing it with the character of an intrastate sale qua the delivery state.the result therefore is that the delivery state only would be entitled to tax the transaction of sale or purchase covered by the explanation.', '2003_794.txt': 'therefore this decision in isha marbles cannot be taken advantage of by the appellant at all in this case.that this aspect is under consideration in another matter before this court.the said rule clearly indicates that it is a mode of recovery of the excise dues from the assets owned by a predecessor and on his liabilities being assessed could be recovered even from the successor.section 29 2 of the state act makes it clear that the property pledged mortgaged hypothecated or assigned to the financial corporation can be brought to sale and such a sale if resulted in transfer of property shall vest in the successor all rights in the property transferred as if the transfer has beencould be recovered even from the successor.the argument advanced by the appellant that sale having taken place under the state act free of encumbrances and the transferor s rights or liabilities cannot be that of transferee does not hold good.we are not impressed with the argument that the state act is a special enactment and the same would prevail over the central excise act.', '1952_75.txt': 'the first court dismissed the plaintiffs claim on the merits holding that government had the right to amend its

follow the decision of their revenue tribunals.consequently. their lordships held that that question was outside the scope of the bar.they said. mr. gumaste. who appears for the appellant. says that his claim is not a claim against the government but in that case be ought to strike out the government.but. if they remain a party. it seems to me that there is a claim against them relating to property appertaining to the office of an hereditary officer. although no doubt it is quite true that the appellant does not desire to get any order against the government as to the way in which the property should be dealt with or anything of the sort. and he only wants a declaration as to his title which will bind government.', '1959_189.txt': 'the facts which led to this appeal may be shortly
