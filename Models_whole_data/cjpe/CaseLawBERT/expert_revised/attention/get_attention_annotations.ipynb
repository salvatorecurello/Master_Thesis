there is a proposition by one party and an opposition to that proposition by another a lis arises. it may be conceded. though not deciding it. that when the assessee files his return a lis may not immediately arise. for under section 11. 1. the authority may accept the return as correct and complete. but if the authority is not satisfied as to the correctness of the return and calls for evidence. surely a controversy arises involving a proposition by the assessee and an opposition by the state. the circumstance that the authority who raises the dispute is himself the judge can make no difference. for the authority raises the dispute in the interest of the state and in so acting only represents the state. it 1000 will appear from the dates given above that in this case the lis in the sense explained above arose before the date of amendment of the section. further. even if the lis is to be taken as arising only on the date of assessment. there was a possibility of such a lis

award itself. the tribunal has found that the appellant was in financial difficulties at the relevant time it has found that the appellant was not actuated by any malafide intention. it has come to the conclusion that the lay. off was not the result of any uleriort motive. and yet it has finally come to the conclusion that if the affairs of the appellant it had been better managed and more

proceedings commenced on 28 7 1998 and on the same day i. e 28 7 1998 he was suspended. from this the high court concluded that the act of suspension was an after thought. consequently the high court

pass such an order. admittedly the disciplinary proceedings had commenced on 28 7 1998. even if before that date the said respondent had been empanelled for promotion the government cannot be prohibited from starting disciplinary proceedings if there are reasons for doing so. the high court has not quashed the disciplinary proceedings and looking at the charges leveled against the

committing the planned crime. in the case of an offence involving physical violence the person who instigates or aids the commission of the crime must be physically present and such presence of those who in one way or the other facilitate the execution of the common design is itself tantamount to actual participation in the criminal act insofar as common intention is concerned it is a state of mind of an accused which can be inferred objectively from his conduct displayed in the course of commission of crime and also from prior and subsequent attendant circumstances. as observed in hari ram

proved facts of the case and the proved circumstances. therefore in order to bring home the charge of common intention the prosecution has to establish by evidence whether direct or circumstantial that there was plan or meeting of mind of all the accused persons to commit the offence before a person can be vicariously convicted for the act of the other. the facts in the present case in the light of the evidences on record are that a 1 and a 2 are brothers having an old enmity with the deceased resulting in a constant skirmish over the well located in their lands. on the said date of

the judgment and converted the order of acquittal into an order of conviction. but it should not have put the accused to the botheration and expense of a second trial simply because the prosecution
