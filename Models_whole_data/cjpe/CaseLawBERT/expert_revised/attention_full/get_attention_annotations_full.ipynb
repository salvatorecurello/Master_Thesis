the status and dignity of the appellant. and this. it was submitted. was fortified by the letter of the appellants husband dated november 19. 1949. where his highness stated that the appellants abru. prestige. would go if she were to lose the village. reference in this connection was also made to the appellants letter dated may 26. 1949. wherein she insisted that the village should not be taken away from her as this would be unreasonable. arbitrary and contrary to the spirit of the covenant. in our opinion the connection of the appellant is well founded. the tribunal has found after going into all the documents including the document containing the words to maintain her status and dignity and the letter of the appellants husband to mr. buch which mentioned the word abru that the grant of the village was by way of maintenance and merely because the appellants relations wanted a face. saving device by splitting up the total amount payable per year it would not change the nature of the transaction nor would it change the grant of maintenance made to the appellant into something else. the grant of the village was as much by way of maintenance as was the cash allowance called jiwai. maintenance must vary according to the position and status of a person. it does not only mean food and raiment. the appellant was the wife of a ruling prince and at the time the grant of the village was made. she was the raj mata and therefore neither the use of the words status and dignity nor the reference to ancient usage could in any way change the nature of the grant. it is true that the appellant was anxious to retain the village because that gave her the satisfaction of having agricultural land which would be a tangible asset providing her a sure source of income but. merely because she wanted the village and in the resolution of march 30. 1950. mention is made of a sum an lieu of income from the village. the nature of the grant which in this case was by way of maintenance would not change. the question which was referred to the high court was whether there was material to hold that the sum of rs. 35. 807 was maintenance allowance. but the high court reformulated this question and after going into various documents it came to a conclusion different from that of the tribunal and it reversed the findings of the tribunal and answered the question in a manner suggestive of an appellate rather than advisory jurisdiction.',\n"," '1953_14.txt': 'may not be in a position to find the necessary money in time. further this argument cannot prevail in view of the decision of the calcutta high court in nagendra nath bose v. mon mohan singha. supra.. no cogent argument has been adduced before us to show that that decision is not correct. there can be no doubt that the new requirement touches the substantive right of appeal vested in the appellant. nor can it be overlooked that such a requirement is calculated to interfere with or fetter. if not to impair or imperil. the substantive right. the right that the amended section gives is certainly less than the right which was available before. a provision which is calculated to deprive the appellant of the unfettered right of appeal cannot be regarded as a mere alteration in procedure. indeed the new requirement cannot be said merely to regulate the exercise of the appellants pre. existing right but in truth whittles down the right itself and cannot be regarded as a mere rule of procedure. finally. sri ganapathy lyer faintly urges that until actual assessment there can be no lis and. therefore. no right of appeal can accrue before that event. there are two answers to this plea. whenever there is a proposition by one party and an opposition to that proposition by another a lis arises. it may be conceded. though not deciding it. that when the assessee files his return a lis may not immediately arise. for under section 11. 1. the authority may accept the return as correct and complete. but if the authority is not satisfied as to the correctness of the return and calls for evidence. surely a controversy arises involving a proposition by the assessee and an opposition by the state. the circumstance that the authority who raises the dispute is himself the judge can make no difference. for the authority raises the dispute in the interest of the state and in so acting only represents the state. it 1000 will appear from the dates given above that in this case the lis in the sense explained above arose before the date of amendment of the section. further. even if the lis is to be taken as arising only on the date of assessment. there was a possibility of such a lis arising as soon as proceedings started with the filing of the return or. at any rate. when the authority called for evidence and started the hearing and the right of appeal must be taken to have been in existence even at those dates. for the purposes of the accrual of the right of appeal the critical and relevant date is the date of initiation of the proceedings and not the decision itself.',\n"," '1952_60.txt': 'a and 49. b were not therefore attracted to it and that no substantial question of law in respect to the construction of the section fell to be decided by this court and that being so. this court should not entertain this appeal under article 136 of the constitution. this contention has no validity. the mills were granted exemption from the provisions of chapter iv. a of the factories act because their leave rules were in accordance with the provisions of chapter iv. a of the factories act. these rules being in similar terms. the decision of the matter depends on the construction of the rules and this in. volves a substantial question of law. reliance was next placed on section 49. a of the factories act which provides that the provisions of the new act would not operate to the prejudice of any rights which the workers were entitled to under the earlier rules and it was argued that under the leave rules of the mills which prevailed prior to the coming into force of the factories act. the workers were entitled to privilege leave and there was no provision in those rules similar to the one that has been made in section 49. b or in the new rules and that the mills had no right to deprive them of leave by reason of the strike. this contention cannot be sustained because section 49. a. 2. of the factories act has no application to the case of the carnatic mills in view of the notification dated 23rd august. 1946. lastly. it was urged that the stoppage of work on 1st november. 1948. was not a concerted action. on the part of the workers and that several workers in their own individual capacity wanted leave on that date. in our opinion. in view of the facts and circumstances detailed in the adjudicators award this contention cannot be seriously considered. we concur in the view of the facts taken by the adjudicator that the action of the 859 workers on the night of 1st november. 1948. fell within the definition of the word strike as given in section 2. q. of the industrial disputes act and it was an illegal strike and the workers thus lost the benefit of holidays that they would have otherwise got under the rules. the learned counsel for the appellant undertook on behalf of the management ex gratia that it would condone the default of the workers on 1st november. 1948. and the cessation of work on that night would not be treated as depriving them of the holidays under the rules and we appreciate. the spirit in which this undertaking was given and hope that the workers would also take it in that spirit.',\n"," '1951_64.txt': 'way to be affected. this has only to be stated to show the commercial nature of the transaction from the companys point of view. the high court considered that the capital of the compa. ny could have been reduced in other ways. but that again is not the point. there are usually many ways in which a given thing can be brought about in business circles but it is not for the court to decide which of them should have been employed when the court is deciding a question under section 12. 2. of the income. tax act. it was argued on behalf of the respondent. basing the same on paragraph 7 of the appellants application to the high court dated 5th april. 1947. that the company had at the time sufficient liquid resources to effect the reduction of capital desired and so it was not necessary to resort to this process. but that again is not the point. the company chose to do it this way. and as there was not even a sugges. tion of fraud. the only question is whether it was gone through as an ordinary commercial proposition. but we doubt if that is what paragraph 7 meant because in paragraph 4 of the application to the high court dated 11th february. 1944. the petitioner stated that the money on hand and at short notice was only rs. 8. 94. 379. that is a good deal short of 50 lacs. however. we need not enter into this in detail. on a full review of the facts it is clear that this transaction was voluntarily entered into in order indirectly to facilitate the carrying on of the business of the company and was made on the ground of commercial expediency. it therefore falls within the purview of section 12. 2. of the income. tax act. 1922 before its amendment in 1939. this being an investment company. if it borrowed money and utilised the same for its investments on which it earned income. the interest paid by it on the loans will clearly be a permissible deduction under section 12. 2. of the income. tax act. whether the loan is taken on an overdraft. or is a fixed deposit or on a debenture makes no difference in law. the only argument urged against allowing this deduction to be made is that the person who took the debentures was the party who sold the ordinary shares. it cannot be disputed that if the debentures were held by a third party. the interest payable on the same would be an allowable deduction in calculating the total income of the assessee company. what difference does it make if the holder of the debentures is a shareholder.',\n"," '1962_384.txt': 'ulterior purpose. the position would be the same. it would dot be a lay. off as contemplated by a. 2. kkk.. but when dealing with a lay. off like the one with which we are concerned in the present appeal it would not be open to the tribunal to enquire whether the appellant could have avoided the lay off if he had been more diligent. more careful or more far. sighted. that is a matter relating to the management of the undertaking and unless malafides are alleged or proved. it would be difficult to assume that the industrial tribunal has jurisdiction to sit in judgment over the acts of management of the employer and investigate whether a more prudent management could have avoided the situation which led to lay. off. the danger involved in permitting such jurisdiction to the tribunal is illustrated by the present award itself. the tribunal has found that the appellant was in financial difficulties at the relevant time it has found that the appellant was not actuated by any malafide intention. it has come to the conclusion that the lay. off was not the result of any uleriort motive. and yet it has finally come to the conclusion that if the affairs of the appellant it had been better managed and more foresight had been shown by the appellant prior to the time when the crisis was reached. pig iron could have been secured and lay. off could have been avoided. apart from. the fact that this conclusion does not appear to be borne out by any evidence on record. it seems to us that the tribunal exceeded its jurisdiction in trying to decide whether better. management could have avoided the crisis. the appellant is. no doubt. expected to manage its affairs prudently. but it would. we think. not be reasonable or fair to hold that if the employer is faced with a situation under which for lack of raw materials he has to lay. off his workmen. it is necessary that he must submit to an enquiry by the industrial tribunal about the prudence of the management and the forethought displayed by it in anticipating and avoiding the difficulties. that is why we think in embarking upon an enquiry as to whether the appellant had shown sufficient foresight in managing its affairs. the tribunal has exceeded its jurisdiction. besides. as we have just indicated. its finding on the question of negligence is not supported by any evidence on record nor by probabilities in the case. in that connection. it is significant that subsequently the section in question has been closed and the retrenched workmen have been paid retrenchment compensation due to them.',\n","

disciplinary proceedings commenced on 28 7 1998 and on the same day i. e 28 7 1998 he was suspended. from this the high court concluded that the act of suspension was an after thought. consequently the high court directed that no effect should be given to the order of suspension and the select list for promotion should be given effect to forthwith. we are at a loss the understand as to how the high court could pass such an order. admittedly the disciplinary proceedings had commenced on 28 7 1998. even if before that date the said respondent had been empanelled for promotion the government cannot be prohibited from starting disciplinary proceedings if there are reasons for doing so. the high court has not quashed the disciplinary proceedings and looking at the charges leveled against the respondent it cant of be said that there was any ulterior motive for the respondent being put under suspension. furthermore where disciplinary proceedings are pending we are doubtful whether it was appropriate for the high court to have directed that the select list for promotion should be given effect to forthwith especially when the high court in the said order has permitted the disciplinary proceedings to continue. it is also difficult to appreciate the high court holding that even though disciplinary proceedings could continue but no final order should be passed. no reasons for coming to this conclusion have been given. we therefore have no hesitation in set ting aside the impugned judgment of the high court. the effect of this would be that respondent 1 who was reinstated pursuant to an order passed by the high court during the proceedings for contempt which are stated to have been initiated by the respondent would be placed under suspension forthwith till

bank for transmission to calcutta. after the purpose for which the moneys were entrusted was carried out. in the absence of further instructions the defendant did not cease to be a trustee. so long as instructions were not given by the plaintiff for appropriation of the amounts the bank continued to hold the amounts transmitted for and on behalf of the plaintiff and there is no evidence that the plaintiff gave instructions or acquiesced in the opening of a fixed deposit account after the same reached calcutta. it is immaterial that the bank purported to open fixed deposit account in the name of the plaintiff with the amounts received at its head office at lahore. that course of action was adopted without the consent of the plaintiff and it could not bind the plaintiff. the high court was. therefore. right in holding that the amount delivered by the plaintiff to the bank at lahore remained in trust even after it reached calcutta. and it was not held by the bank. in deposit for the

of possession to the appellants fixed the date for completion of the rebuilding and agreed between themselves as to repossession by the respondents. it was submitted that although the time for giving delivery to the appellants was fixed in the compromise it was not of the essence of the contract. in our opinion the contentions raised by the appellants are well founded and the appellants must

would really be the result of the claimants entitled to the same not receiving it under certain circumstances. an event which would be purely an extraneous one and unconnected with the contribution of the respondents towards the gross profits earned by the appellant. the tribunal was. therefore. right in calculating the bonus on an all. india basis. by our order dated april 12. 1957. the appellant

therein. having regard to all the circumstances of the case. we feel that an award of four months basic wages as aggregate bonus for the year 1954. 55. which by the way was the bonus awarded for the previous year 1953. 54 also. would give a fair share to the labour in the distributable surplus. leaving to the shareholders and the company a balance of rs. 5. 22 lacs to be utilised by them not only towards building up of the debenture redemption reserve but also for building up other reserves. which would be utilised for various other purposes indicated above.',\n"," '1951_10.txt': 'was clear

dealing in shares of other companies. the shares of the sholapur mills were treated by them as capital investment for the purpose of maintaining their managing agency. the number of shares held by the

belief could have been reasonable. the statutory presumption cannot be raised. in our opinion. this argument is not well. founded. there are two broad features of this seizure which cannot be igno. red. the first feature on which the officer relied is supplied by the quantity of gold in question. it was found that the appellant was carrying on his person five pieces of gold bullion weighing as much as 290. 6 tolas. this large quantity of gold valued at nearly rs. 30. 000.. itself justified a reasonable belief in the mind of the officer that the gold may be smuggled. in that connection. it

intercepted by the officer on the 25th october. 1956. at the raigarb railway station at 16. 30 hours. then the other fact on which the reasonable belief can be founded is the suspicious circumstances of the appellants journey. the appellant was found travelling without a railway ticket and his explanation as to how he came to be. in the said passenger train is obviously untrue. a person carrying a. large quantity of gold and found travelling without a ticket may well have raised a reasonable belief in the mind of the officer that the gold was smuggled. the object of travelling without a ticket must have been to conceal the fact that the appellant had travelled all the way from calcutta at which place the gold must have been smuggled. the story subsequently mentioned by the appellant about his journey to tatanagar which has been disbelieved brings into bold belief the purpose which the appellant had in mind in travelling without a ticket. after. all.. when we are dealing with a question as to whether the belief in the mind of the officer who effected the seizure was reasonable or not. we are not sitting in appeal over the decision of the said officer. all that we can consider is whether there is ground which prima facie justifies the said reasonable belief. that being so. we do not think there is any substance in the argument that the seizure was effected without

that the order was followed by the service of a fresh set of grounds on the petitioner as required by sec. tion 7 of the act a proceeding which would be wholly unnec. essary if no fresh order of detention was intended. indeed. it was suggested on behalf of the petitioner that the said order followed by service of fresh grounds only four days before the date fixed for the hearing of the

the detention of the person concerned for such period as it thinks fit. section 11.. it is. therefore. plain that it is only after the advisory board. to which the case has been referred. reports that the detention is justified. the government should determine what the period of deten. tion should be and not before. the fixing of the period of detention in the initial order itself in the present case was. therefore. contrary to the scheme of the act and cannot be supported. the learned advocate. general. however. urged that in view of the provision in section 11. 2. that if the advisory board reports that there is no sufficient cause for the detention. the person concerned would be released forth. with. the direction in the order dated 30th july. 1951. that the petitioner should be

at page 20. the polling agents appointed for the same candidate to attend the several polling stations at any election. are engaged on the same duty and in the same interest. and it is generally very desirable that they should meet. under the presidency of the candidate or his election agent. before the opening of the poll for the purpose of mutual discussion and co. operation. what that passage means is that as the duty to be performed by the polling agents at the several booths is of the same character. it would be desirable that they should all be assembled and their duties explained to them. this has no bearing on the question whether those duties are such as must inherently promote the election prospects of the candidate. a passage which is more in point is the one at page 18.

is a rather super. ficial view of the matter. in the earlier cases their lordships were considering the quantum of interest trans. ferred by a mortgagor to a mortgagee in a mortgage of leasehold interest for the purpose of determining whether or not there was privity of estate between the landlord and the mortgagee. if the mortgage could operate as an assign. ment of the entire interest of the mortgagor in the lease. the mortgagee would be liable by privity of estate for the burdens of the lease. if on the other hand. it operated only as a partial assignment of the mortgagors interest. no such result would follow. it was in determining that issue that their lordships held that no privity of estate arose in india because a legal interest remained in the mortgagor and the interest taken by the mortgagee was not an absolute interest. these cases had no bearing on the question. which arose in promode kumar roy v. nikhil bhusan mukhopadhya. 1. and arises in the present case. as to

entered into for a variety of reasons. and the benamidar holds the property in trust for his principal. in the present case. the object of the benami transaction was merely to keep the property from being resumed by the bettiah raj on the expiry of the lease in favour of radhumal. which undoubtedly the bettiah raj could have done. if it had been so minded. the information about the benami transaction was. however. not withheld from the bettiah raj. and even with that knowledge. the bettiah raj took no action against radhumal or the benamidars. the plaintiffs recanted inasmuch as they asserted their true title and true facts before the occasion for the raj to act arose. thus. the fraud. though intended. was not perpetrated. because the fraud could only be effected at the end of the lease term. and the locus poenitentiae which the lessee possessed was duly used long before the expiry of the lease. the illegality was also of a trivial character. inasmuch as the signatures of

put forward a case that the state government was not the transferor of the property and the learned judges of the high court should have proceeded on the basis of the pleadings in the case. apart from this question of pleading. we consider that there is no merit in the contention even otherwise. we have already set out the terms by which the transfer of the land was communicated to the municipal committee. the preamble recites that is what being communicated is the order of the government of the central provinces. the words of conveyance are in the second paragraph and they read under section 38. 1.. f. of the central provinces municipalities act. 1922 government is pleased to transfer to the municipal committee. the expression government here obviously. in the context. means the government of the central provinces. paragraph 2 which specifies what should happen if the condition on which the land has been granted should be broken. states the land shall be liable to be.

further. in condition 3 which speaks of what was to happen if the land was resumed by government for any government purpose the reference to government again is to the state government. on the terms of the document therefore it was the government of the central provinces that made the grant. the predecessor of the state government. we find therefore that there is no factual foundation for the submission which was apparently made before the high court that the transfer in the present case was by the central government. no doubt. the communication refers to the fact that previous to making the grant the government of c. p. berar had obtained the approval of the central government. but that was merely a matter of administrative arrangement between the central and local governments which is totally irrelevant for determining the identity of the government which made the grant. besides. the corporation having accepted the grant from the state government was obviously estopped from contending that the land of which it continued in possession under that grant was not one by the state government or that the state government had not the authority to make the grant. if such

necessary to provide adequate remedy for making the government decision binding and final. having regard to the unqualified and absolute prohibition contained in s. 31a. 1.. c. it seems to us difficult to hold that the payment of bonus to the employees of insurance companies is not absolutely conditioned by proviso. vii.. in the absence of the said provision no bonus could have been claimed by insurance employees. and so the effect of the said provision must be to limit the said right to the conditions prescribed by it. that is why we think that the tribunal was right in coming to the conclusion that the reference made by the central government is invalid. the fact that the central government took the view that it could make such a reference 1001 is hardly relevant in determining the scope and effect of the relevant provisions of the act. this question must be considered on what we regard to be the fair construction of the relevant statutory provision. and as we have just indicated the construction of the relevant provision clearly supports the view taken by the tribunal. incidentally. it may be pointed out that in its award the tribunal has referred to several other decisions of industrial tribunals which have taken the same view though there are one or two decisions which have upheld the validity of the reference without duly considering the effect

to consider the effect of s. 10 of the banking companies act. 1949. prior to its amendment in 1956. the said section. according to that decision. prohibited the grant of industrial bonus to bank employees inasmuch as such bonus is remuneration which takes the form of a share in the profits of a banking company. in dealing with the character of bonus in relation to remuneration specified by s.

desire to redeem a subsisting mortgage and the procedure which follows the arising of a usufructuary mortgagors right to get his property back after the principal has been paid off. we therefore hold

of the occupants other than the registered occupant desires to relinquish his occupancy. he cannot himself give a notice of relinquishment but must give it by and through the registered occupant nevertheless the registered occupant. in the absence of any authority. express or implied. to be clearly pleaded and strictly proved. has no inherent or independent. 1. 22 bom l. r. 1431. right to

proceedings arising out of the same facts are now. pending against the appellants. one is two civil suits for damages for wrongful confinement. the other. is two criminal prosecutions under section 344. indian penal code. for wrongful confinement. one against each sub. inspector. it was said that the simultaneous prosecution of these. matters will embarrass the accused. but after the hearing of the appeal we received information that the two criminal prosecutions have been closed with liberty to file fresh complaints when the papers are ready. as the high court records were not available on the application of the accused as these prosecutions are not pending at the moment. the objection regarding them does not arise but we can see that the simultaneous prosecution of the present criminal proceedings out of which this appeal arises and the civil suits will embarrass the accused. we have therefore to determine which should be stayed. as between the civil and the criminal proceedings we are of the opinion that the criminal matters should 1149 be given precedence. there is some difference of opinion in the high courts of india on this point. no hard and fast rule ban. be laid down but we do not consider that the possibility of conflicting decisions in the civil and criminal courts is a relevant consideration. the law envisages such an eventuality when it expressly refrains from making the decision of one court binding on the other. or even relevant. except for certain limited purposes. such as sentence or damages. the only relevant consideration here is the likelihood of embarrassment. another factor which weighs with us is that a civil suit often drags on for years and it is undesirable that a criminal prosecution should wait till everybody concerned has forgotten all about the crime. the public interests demand that criminal justice should be swift and sure that the guilty should be punished while the events are still fresh in the public mind and that the innocent should be absolved as early as is consistent with a fair and impartial trial. another reason is that it is undesirable to let things glide till memories have grown too dim to trust. this. however. is not a hard and fast rule. special considerations obtaining in any particular case might make some other course more expedient and just. for example. the civil case or the other criminal proceeding may be so hear its end as to make it inexpedient to stay it in order to give precedence to a prosecution order of under section 476. but in this case we are of the view that the civil suits should be stayed till the criminal proceedings have finished.',\n"," '1954_158.txt': 'he is completely protected and it is immaterial that the necessity was brought about by the mismanagement of the

of the sale. the position therefore is that if there is no necessity in fact or if the alienee could not prove that he made bona fide enquiries and was satisfied about its existence. the transfer is undoubtedly not void but the transferee would get only the widows estate in the property which does not affect in any way the interest of the reversioner. in this case the alienation was by way of mortgage. the finding of both the courts below is that there was no legal necessity which justified the execution of the security bond. the mortgagee also could not prove that there was representation of the legal necessity and that she satisfied herself by bona fide enquiries that such necessity did exist. on this point the. finding recorded by the high court is as follows in the present case. there is no scope for an argument that there was such representation of legal necessity or that on bona fide enquiry the alienee satisfied herself that there was such a necessity. for as i have already pointed out the security bond itself states that it was in consideration of benefits already received and with a view to induce suhasini to forbear from proceeding against mohini. that the

of any other legal necessity. whatever enquiries the appellants may have made. 1. 6 m. i. a. would be of no avail to them when the alienation is not binding on the whole estate but only on the womans estate of rashmoni. in our opinion the view taken by the high court is quite proper. on this finding the security bond could operate only on the widows estate of rashmoni and it was that interest alone which passed to the purchase. at the mortgage sale. the subsequent transferee could not claim to have acquired any higher right than what his predecessor had and it is immaterial whether he bona

within the eastern states agency. on 15th december. 1947. the ruler entered into a covenant of merger. in that covenant the properties in question were recognised as the personal properties of the ruler as distinct from the state properties. reference is made to article 362 which provides that in the exercise of the per of parliament or of the legislature of a state to make laws or in the exercise of the executive power of the union or of a state. due regard shall be had to the guarantee or assurance given under any such covenant or agreement as is referred to in clause. 1. of article 291 with respect to the personal rights privileges and dignities of the ruler of an indian state. it is said that the impugned act is bad as it contravenes the above provisions. the occur to me several answers to this contention. the guarantee or assurance to which due regard is to be had is limited to personal rights. privileges and dignities of the ruler qua a ruler. it does not extend to personal property which is different from personal rights. further this article does not import any legal obligation but is an assurance only. all that the covenant does is to recognise the title of the ruler as owner of certain properties. to say that the ruler is the power of certain properties is not to say that those properties shall in no circumstances be acquired by the state. the fact that his personal properties are sought to be acquired on payment of compensation clearly recognises his title just as the titles of other proprietors are recognised. finally. the jurisdiction of the court to decide any dispute arising out of the covenant is barred by article 363.',\n"," '1959_26.txt': '. the language used in the affidavit was the above commission was verbally decided to be paid to

of the place of payment would depend upon the agreement between the parties or the course of conduct of the parties. if it is shown that the creditor authorised the debtor either expressly or

considered as a part of the surrounding circumstances the parties must have intended that the cheques should be sent by post which is the usual and normal mode of transmission and therefore the posting of cheques in delhi amounted to payment in. 1. 1955 1 s. c. r. 185. delhi to the post office which was constituted the agent of the assessee. but it was argued for the respondents that in the

such request. express or implied. then the delivery of the letter or the cheque to the post office is delivery to the agent of the sender himself. it was further contended that in this case there was an express agreement that the payment was to be made at secunderabad and therefore the matter does not fall within the rule in ogale glass works case. 1. and the following principle laid down in judgment by das. j.. as he then was.. is inapplicable. applying the above principles to the facts found by the tribunal the position appears to be this. the engagement of the government was to make

appreciation of the evidence by the trial court was so thoroughly erroneous as to be wholly unacceptable to the appellate court. if the high court could come to the conclusion. it could have reversed the judgment and converted the order of acquittal into an order of conviction. but it should not have put the accused to the botheration and expense of a second trial simply because the prosecution

our judgment. entirely misdirected itself in setting aside the order of acquittal and making an order for a fresh trial by another magistrate. simply on the ground that the case was between a lawyer and his client. simply because the accused happened to be a lawyer would not be a ground for subjecting him to harassment a second time. there being no reason for holding that his prosecutor had not a fair chance of bringing the charge home to him. in our opinion. the high court gave way to considerations which were not relevant to a criminal trial. the high court was not sitting on a disciplinary proceeding for professional misconduct. it had to apply the same rules of criminal jurisprudence as. apply to all criminal trials. and. in our opinion. the only. reason given by the high court for ordering retrial is against all well. established rules of criminal jurisprudence. the fact that the appellant is a practising lawyer does not entitle him to any preferential treatment when he is hauled up on a criminal charge. even as he is not subject to any additional disability because the cam was between a lawyer and his client. there was no relationship of lawyer and client so far as the

the penalty was not attracted in the present case at all. she also relied upon the decision of this court in isha marbles v bihar state electricity board and anr to contend that in case of sales effected under section 29 1 of the state act the recovery of dues of previous owner from the auction purchaser could not be made. now taking the last contention first we may notice that this court in isha marbles considered the scope of section 24 of the electricity act and held that there is no charge over the property in question and when a premises comes to be owned or purchased by the auction purchaser he cannot be called upon to clear the past arrears when such purchaser seeks supply of electric energy or it is made clear in that decision that what matters is the contract entered into by the erstwhile consumer with the board and the board cannot seek the enforcement of contractual liability against the third party. therefore this decision in isha marbles cannot be taken advantage of by the appellant at all in this case. in this case the liability arises under the central excise act and rule 230 2 of the central excise rules. the said rule clearly indicates that it is a mode of recovery of the excise dues from the assets owned by a predecessor and on his liabilities being assessed could be recovered even from the successor. the argument advanced by the appellant that sale having taken place under the state act free of encumbrances and the transferor s rights or liabilities cannot be that of transferee does not hold good. section 29 2 of the state act makes it clear that the property pledged mortgaged hypothecated or assigned to the financial corporation can be brought to sale and such a sale if resulted in transfer of property shall vest in the successor all rights in the property transferred as if the transfer has been made by the owner of the property. when sale made by the corporation is deemed to be a sale made by the owner of the property necessarily rule 230 2 of the central excise rules would be attracted. we are not impressed with the argument that the state act is a special enactment and the same would prevail over the central excise act. each of them is a special enactment and unless in the operation of the same any conflict arises this aspect need not be examined. in this case no such conflict arises between the corporation and the excise department. hence it is unnecessary to examine this aspect of the matter.',\n"," '1952_75.txt': 'true that the appellant does not desire to get any order against the government as to the way in which

decide whether government acted in excess of its powers and that that question must be decided first. in my opinion. this decision does not apply here. their lordships were dealing with a case falling under section 4. b. of the bombay revenue jurisdiction act of 1876. that provides that. no civil court shall exercise jurisdiction as to. b. objections to the amount or incidence of any assessment of land revenue authorised by the provincial government. as pointed out by strangman k. c. on behalf of the plaintiff respondent. authorised must mean duly authorised and in that particular case the impugned assessment would not be duly authorised if the government resolution of 11. 4. 1930 purporting to treat the agreement relied on by the respondent as cancelled and authorising the levy of the full assessment was ultra vires under section 211 of the land revenue code. thus. before the exclusion of the civil courts jurisdiction under section 4. b. could come into play. the court had to determine the issue of ultra vires. consequently. their lordships held that that question was outside the scope of the bar. but the position here is different. we are concerned here with section 4. a. under that no question about an authorised act of government arises. the section is general and bars all claims against the crown relating to lands held as saranjam. that is to say. even if the government act is relation to such lands was ultra vires. a claim impugning the validity of such an act would fall within the scope of the exclusion in clause. a. provided it relates to such land. there is a difference of opinion in the bombay high court as to whether section 4 is attracted if the only relief sought against government is a declaration. one set of decision holds that that does not amount to a claim against government. dattatraya vishwanath v. the secretary of state for india i. l. r. 1948 bom. 809 at 820 is typical of that view.',\n"," '1959_189.txt': 'made an application
